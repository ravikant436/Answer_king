7,1197) have brought about the entry of their company in the commercial register according to § 3 HGB
8,"b) For farmers and foresters not falling under Section 140 AO 1977, the accounting obligation in Section 141 Paragraph 1 and 2 AO 1977 (until 31 December 1976: Section 161 Paragraph 1 RAO i"

11,"Farmers and foresters are to be asked to transfer to the bookkeeping if, according to the findings of the tax office, they have aa) sales, including tax-free sales, excluding sales according to § 4 No. 8 and 9 UStG, of more than DM 360,000 per calendar year or bb) agricultural and forestry assets of more than 100,000 DM or cc) a profit from agriculture and forestry of more than 15,000 DM in the calendar year"
12,"2 Asset limit After the purpose of this asset limit, the objective size of the agricultural and forestry operation must be taken into account"
13,"It is therefore irrelevant whether the business belongs to the farmer and forest manager, has been leased by him or whether the farmer and forest manager has leased individual areas"
14,"The leased areas are managed like their own property and, like them, influence the size and profitability of the company"
15,"Therefore, in the interests of equal tax treatment of farmers and foresters who only use their own agricultural land and those who also cultivate leased land, it is necessary to take the leased land into account when determining the bookkeeping limit (HMdF decree of 31 January 1977 - Az"
16,: S-2163 A - 6 - II B 11)
17,Agricultural and forestry assets in this sense therefore include all areas and assets that are available to the farmer and forestry manager for the management of the business or that are part of his business assets from an income tax point of view
18,The value of the assets to be taken into account is to be determined in accordance with the principles and regulations applicable to unit valuation
19,The leased agricultural land and the land provided free of charge are to be set at the comparative value of the agricultural use
20,"If there is no special comparative value for the leased agricultural land and the agricultural land provided free of charge, the value to be taken into account is to be calculated according to the hectare value that was used as the basis for the unit assessment for one's own farm for the comparative value of agricultural use"
21,Agricultural areas that have been assigned to the real estate in the unit valuation according to § 69 BewG and valued at the common value are to be set at the value that would result from the regulations on the valuation of agricultural and forestry assets
22,This value is to be calculated according to the hectare value that has been or should be taken as a basis for the unit valuation for the own farm for the comparison value of the respective use
23,3 Profit limit The profit limit relates to the profit for the calendar year
24,"If the business year deviates from the calendar year, the profit from two business years divided over the calendar year is decisive"
25,"Insofar as the profit determined for the financial year has been reduced by increased deductions or special depreciations for assets that have been purchased or manufactured after December 31, 1974, the profits for the examination of whether the profit limit has been exceeded are to be increased by these increased deductions or Increase special depreciation and then split it over time (Section 7a (7) EStG 1975)"
26,"The same also applies to special depreciations and deductions from profits according to Sections 76 to 78 EStDV, which were made before Section 7a EStG 1975 came into force (Sections 76 (6) 77 (5) 78 (5) EStDV in those valid up to VZ 1974 Versions), as well as for reserves according to § 3 ForstschAusglG (§ 3 Abs 5 ForstschAusglG)"

28,Section 161 (1) RAO i
29,"Section 1, Paragraph 1 of the LandwBuchfVO, the accounting obligation for farmers and foresters began at the beginning of the financial year relevant for the determination of profits for income tax, which followed the point in time when it was first determined for an assessment for income tax or sales tax or for a unit valuation, that one of the limits specified in Section 161 (1) RAO had been exceeded and the farmer and forester was informed of the start of the accounting obligation"
30,The special notification could be included in the notification or issued separately
31,"b) Legal situation from 1 1 1977 According to § 141 Abs 2 AO 1977 the accounting obligation for farmers and foresters begins with the beginning of the financial year following the announcement of the notification, through which the tax authority has informed the farmer and forest manager that According to their findings, one of the bookkeeping limits specified in Section 141 (1) AO 1977 has been exceeded for the individual company and he is obliged to keep books for this company and to make financial statements on the basis of annual inventories"
32,aa) Findings of the tax authorities According to the administrative instructions for the application of the AO 1977 (cf. BStBl 1976 I S
33,576 ff
34,", on § 141), the findings of the tax authority do not necessarily require a tax assessment, assessment notice or an appeal decision"
35,The findings of the tax authority can also be made in another form (e.g.
36,"by taking note of the profit declared by the taxpayer, which obviously exceeds the limit of § 141 Paragraph 1 No. 5 AO 1977; by calculating and taking note of agricultural and forestry assets - see no"
37,"2 - on the basis of the income tax return or the declaration on the main determination of the unit value for the operation of agriculture and forestry or other findings of the tax authority, which obviously exceeds the limit of § 141 Paragraph 1 No. 3 AO 1977)"
38,"The determination of turnover or profit or assets can also relate to periods or points in time before 1 1 1977; however, it must be taken after December 31, 1976"
39,bb) Notification The tax authorities must inform the taxpayer of the beginning of the accounting obligation
40,This notification can be given in a notification or separately; it should be made known to the taxpayer at least one month before the beginning of the financial year from the beginning of which the accounting obligation is to be fulfilled
41,"If the tax authority's determination that one of the accounting requirements has been exceeded is not made in a notification or an appeal decision, the farmer and forest manager must also be informed of the amount of the relevant assets or profit and the basis for calculation (see Appendix 1)"
42,cc) Submission of the opening balance sheet The farmer and forester must also be requested to submit an opening balance sheet immediately after the start of the accounting obligation
43,"Please do not object if, in cases in which agricultural and forestry operations join a data processing system, the opening balance sheet is not submitted until three months after the start of the financial year"
44,5 Discontinuation of the accounting obligation The accounting obligation ends according to
45,"Section 141 (2) sentence 2 AO 1977 with the expiry of the financial year following the financial year in which the tax authority determines that the prerequisites according to § 141 paragraph 1 AO 1977 no longer exist, provided that the tax authority does not renew the existence of the until then Establishes accounting obligation"
46,"If the submitted tax return or the balance sheet does not allow a determination that the prerequisites for the accounting obligation are no longer given, the determination of the possible discontinuation of the accounting obligation will only be made in the corresponding notification"
47,"Although Section 141 (2) AO 1977 does not provide for a notification to the taxpayer about the discontinuation of the accounting obligation, I ask you to inform the farmer and forester by means of a corresponding note in the notification or by separate notification"
48,6 Continuation of the accounting obligation when taking over the company as a whole The accounting obligation is transferred to the person who takes over the company as a whole
49,"The takeover of a business in this sense can take place both by acquisition for a fee or free of charge as well as by leasing, granting of usufruct and the establishment of another comprehensive right to use the business as a whole"
50,7 Handling of complaints against the request for bookkeeping from 1 7 1976 due to exceeding the asset limit I ask all farmers and foresters who have been asked to keep records from 1 7 1976 onwards because the asset limit has been exceeded to check whether the relevant The asset limit was determined in a standard value assessment or an annex to the income tax assessment (initial value plus comparative value of the leased land belonging to agricultural and forestry business assets plus the value of the apartment) and thus the prerequisite for the special request was met
51,"a) If this was not the case, the request for bookkeeping must be withdrawn with effect for the past (Section 130 (1) AO 1977)"
52,"However, it must be checked whether, according to your findings (see 4 b) aa), one of the accounting requirements specified in Section 141 (1) AO 1977 has been exceeded"
53,The farmer and forester is then in accordance with the above
54,Instructions to point out that from 1 7 1977 he is obliged to keep accounts
55,b) Was the above
56,"The prerequisite for the request for bookkeeping is fulfilled and the taxpayer has lodged a complaint, this complaint must be submitted to me"
57,"Regardless of the outcome of this legal remedy procedure, I ask you to check whether, according to your findings, one of the accounting requirements specified in Section 141 (1) AO 1977 has been exceeded"
58,The farmer and forester is then in accordance with the above

64,"373), the taxation of land gains for farmers and foresters, self-employed and small businesses has been newly regulated"
65,"This new regulation essentially consists of the deletion of Section 4 (1) sentence 5 EStG, a supplement to Section 4 (3) EStG, an amendment to Section 14 EStG, the introduction of Section 14a EStG, an amendment to Section 16 (4) EStG, the Addition of a § 55 EStG, the insertion of transitional regulations in § 52 EStG, a supplement to §§ 8 and 12 GDL (for financial years beginning after December 31, 1973, see § 13a Paragraph 6 EStG - BStBl 1974 IS"
66,249)
67,2 Temporal scope of application a) The new regulation only applies to farmers and foresters if the land has been sold or removed after 30 6 1970 (Section 52 (5) EStG 1971; Section 52 (3) EStG 1974; Section 52 (2) EStG 1975)
68,"In the case of small businesses and self-employed persons, the land gain taxation applies if the land was sold or removed after August 14, 1971 (Section 52 (5) EStG 1971; Section 52 (3) EStG 1974; Section 52 (2) EStG 1975)"
69,"Note also to Section 16 (1) EStR 1972b) In the case of farmers and foresters as well as small businesses and self-employed people, increases in land value prior to 1 7 1970 are not taken into account when determining the profit on sale or withdrawal, even in cases where the Land already belonged to business assets on 30 6 1970 (Section 55 (1) EStG)"
70,"Example: If a small business owner sells his property belonging to the business assets before August 15, 1971, this transaction is not significant for income tax purposes"
71,"If the land is sold after August 14, 1971, the new land gain taxation rules apply"
72,"The increases in land value that occurred before 1 7 1970 are not to be taken into account, but the changes in value that occurred between 30 6 1970 and 15 8 1971 and up to the date of sale are to be taken into account"
73,"3 Determination of advance payments In significant cases, the land gains resulting from the sale of the land are to be recorded not only as part of the assessment, but by adjusting the current advance payments or by subsequently increasing the advance payments"
74,II Concept of agricultural and forestry operations 1 Serious agricultural and forestry activities The concept of agricultural and forestry operations does not require a minimum size or the affiliation of farm buildings and resources
75,The serious agricultural use of individual agricultural properties is therefore also agriculture and forestry
76,"According to No. 3 of the decree of 3 5 1972, for reasons of administrative simplification, it can generally be assumed that - apart from the so-called"
77,"Intensive use (vegetable, flower and ornamental plant cultivation, tree nurseries, viticulture, hops, asparagus and tobacco growing, fruit growing and forestry) there is no agricultural or forestry operation if the total land area under cultivation does not exceed 3000 square meters"
78,"If, on the other hand, the self-cultivated land area is more than 3000 square meters, then there is an agricultural and forestry operation if, according to the overall picture, these areas are used seriously for agricultural purposes"
79,"Indications for serious agricultural use can be the scope of the work, the use of machines and devices as well as the ongoing fertilization and spraying of the crops"
80,"Membership in an agricultural professional organization, membership in agricultural purchasing and sales cooperatives, payment of contributions to the agricultural retirement fund, the use of cheaper gas oil and other state measures to improve the agricultural structure can all contribute to the existence of an agricultural and forestry business speak"
81,Agricultural use also exists if the products are only used for personal consumption
82,"In this case, however, serious use cannot be assumed on a regular basis because of the assumed low profitability"
83,Are areas only managed in the interests of landscape protection (e.g.
84,"mowed by the owner or a third party), it can no longer be considered serious agricultural and forestry activity"
85,"If these principles are applied, private house gardens, allotment gardens and weekend properties (see also decree of 3 5 1972) are excluded from the field of agriculture and forestry"
86,"2 Affiliation of land to the business assets The business assets of a farmer and forest manager include: a) the land owned by the business owner; economic ownership is sufficient (cf. Section III No. 2) b) Leased property c) The lowland (§ 44 BewG), z"
87,"Heidelandd) Unland (§ 45 BewG), z"
88,Ditches and embankments) fallow land (social wasteland); These are properties that are temporarily not cultivated for personal or economic reasons
89,"Regarding b) If individual properties of the remaining business are temporarily leased, they remain necessary business assets"
90,"If, on the other hand, they are leased on a long-term basis, the removal of the property can be recognized with evidence of the lease (name of the lessee)"
91,A prerequisite for a tax-recognized withdrawal is that the lease has been seriously agreed and is actually carried out (e.g.
92,for leases between parents and children)
93,"If the permanent lease took place before July 1, 1970 and the withdrawal was expressly declared, the land on July 1, 1970 belonged to private assets"
94,"If the declaration has not been made, the same applies if a) at the time of the lease there was no reason for the lessor to declare the withdrawal for tax purposes (e.g. because"
95,no assessment was carried out) or b) the rental income was shown in the tax return for the assessment period 1969 as income from rental and leasing
96,"Because of the determination of the extraction value in the period up to 30 June 1972 see No. 11 of the decree of 10 3 1972 To e) If individual agricultural areas of an agricultural holding are not used for agricultural purposes for a definite or indefinite period, they generally remain business assets"
97,"If a farmer finally and recognizably ceases to use individual pieces of land, these pieces of land can be removed"
98,This can e.g.
99,be the case if the use was discontinued due to an assignment procedure or due to a development
100,"In addition to the cessation of use, a clear withdrawal action is a prerequisite"
101,"However, the treatment of the property in the standard value method is irrelevant"
102,If all areas of an agricultural holding are no longer used for agricultural purposes - also referred to in parlance as social fallow land - this can be a task for the holding
103,"Are allotments, which according to"
104,"According to Section 34 (7) BewG, if this is an independent business that is permanently fallow, one can no longer speak of a serious agricultural and forestry activity"
105,They therefore belong to private assets from the time of cessation of use
106,This also applies if a third party looks after the area (e.g.
107,mows down)
108,The cessation of use will regularly be associated with an operational cessation (see Section V No. 1)
109,3 Heritable building right The encumbrance of a property belonging to a business asset with a heritable building right does not in itself constitute a withdrawal
110,Land belonging to an agricultural and forestry business asset and which was encumbered with a heritable building right prior to 1 7 1970 therefore still belonged to the property owner's agricultural and forestry business assets on 1 7 1970
111,"Something different only applies if the owner sold his business before 17 1970 without the property encumbered with the heritable building right, gave up his business or removed the property"
112,"If there was neither a sale of a business, nor a cessation of business, nor a withdrawal before 1 7 1970, for reasons of the protection of legitimate expectations in accordance with the administrative instruction contained in No. 6 (1) of the decree of 10 3 1972, a withdrawal can be assumed before 1 7 1970 if the ground rent was treated as income from renting and leasing in the final assessment of the property owner for the assessment period 1969"
113,"4 Usufruct If a usufructuary right is established for an agricultural and forestry operation, the land belonging to the agricultural and forestry operation must be assigned to the legal owner (usufructuary buyer)"
114,Something else only applies if the usufructuary is to be regarded as the beneficial owner of the property as an exception
115,That should z
116,be the case if the owner orders the lifelong usufruct of an agricultural holding in favor of a person who is considerably younger than he and whom he has appointed as his sole heir (see also Section III No. 2)
117,The same applies when ordering a usufruct on individual agricultural and forestry properties
118,"5 examples of the 3000 sqm rule a) Several piece lands of a taxpayer The 3000 sqm limit does not refer to the individual piece land, but to all land areas of a taxpayer"
119,b) Lots of land belonging to a community of heirs
120,"The decisive factor is therefore not the size of the parts of the property attributable to the individual participants, but the size of the entire agricultural holding"
121,c) Application of the 3000 sqm regulation A taxpayer owns the following properties: aa) 2000 sqm arable land 1500 sqm weekend property
122,The weekend property is part of private assets
123,"Since the arable land is no larger than 3000 square meters, it also counts as private assets"
124,"bb) 500 sqm vineyard area 2000 sqm arable area The 3000 sqm regulation does not apply, as there is already an agricultural and forestry operation with regard to the vineyard area and therefore the arable area also represents business assets"
125,"cc) 500 square meters of fallow vineyards 2000 square meters of yielding vineyards, owner-used 1600 square meters of forest 1500 square meters of tree meadow, owner-occupied 1200 square meters of tree meadow leased for DM 120 per year"
126,"In this case, the area used by the owner (including the fallow vineyards, the forest and the tree meadow) is larger than 3000 square meters"
127,All of these areas belong to the agricultural business assets
128,It can only be doubted how the leased meadow is to be treated
129,"If it was already leased permanently on July 1, 1970, and the removal of the meadow was expressly declared before July 1, 1970, or if the lease income was declared in the 1969 income tax return as income from renting and leasing, then there are no concerns To accept private wealth"
130,"If, on the other hand, the meadow is only now leased on a long-term basis, it can be withdrawn with the result that profit is realized"
131,"Insofar as vineyards are listed in the above examples, the decision is to be applied accordingly to other intensively used areas"
132,III Land used for agriculture and forestry in civil-legal property of spouses and children1 General Land and forestry-used land belong to the business assets of an agriculture and forestry sector if they are in the civil-legal or economic property of the business owner
133,Land that belongs to the business owner's spouse is therefore not part of the business owner's business assets
134,2 Economic ownership According to the BFH judgment of 26 1 1970 (BStBl II p
135,264) can only be accepted if the legal owner can be permanently excluded from affecting the economic property so that his claim to surrender no longer has any economic significance
136,These prerequisites will only be met in exceptional cases for the property land
137,Such an exceptional case does not exist if one or both parents in his or her
138,their agricultural and forestry operations co-manage land belonging to a minor child; because the parents' administrative rights over the child's property do not permanently exclude the child from affecting the property
139,Even the free transfer of land from one spouse to the other spouse or the children to one or both parents does not constitute beneficial ownership
140,3 Property regime Allocation of areas of the spouse to the business assets of agriculture and forestry can result from agreements under property law or from an existing corporate relationship between the spouses
141,"In the case of the property regime of the community of property (before July 1, 1958, the property regime of the general community of property), a distinction must be made between the common property and the conditional property"
142,"If the joint property of the spouses includes an agricultural and forestry business, according to the BFH rulings of 18 2 1959 (BStBl III p"
143,263) and from 1 3 1966 (BStBl III p
144,277) to accept co-entrepreneurship between the spouses even without a special agreement
145,"In this case, all property belonging to the spouses used for agricultural and forestry purposes is part of the business assets"
146,It does not matter whether they belong to the common property or to the conditional property of a spouse
147,"If the land belongs to the common property, half of it is attributable to each spouse"
148,Land belonging to a spouse's reserved property is fully attributable to this spouse
149,"If an agricultural and forestry business belongs to the property of a spouse, the following applies to properties that are managed within the framework of this business: Properties that are part of the property of the owner are fully attributable to this property and are business assets"
150,Properties belonging to the other spouse's reserved property are only to be assigned to this spouse and are not part of the business owner's business assets
151,Land belonging to the common property is to be allocated to half of each spouse and half to the business assets of the business owner
152,"4 Co-entrepreneurship A company relationship between spouses that has to be observed for tax purposes exists in the agricultural sector as well as in the commercial sector if both spouses actually contribute to the achievement of the company's purpose through cooperation, provision of capital or the transfer of economic goods, in particular land, as it would be the case in business with strange partners"
153,The contribution must not be of minor importance (cf. the BFH judgment of 3 August 1973 BStBl II p
154,844)
155,"A company is founded by a) the express conclusion of a partnership agreement, b) the tacit behavior of the spouse, which expresses the will to conclude a partnership agreement"
156,"The objective characteristics of co-entrepreneurship - cooperation, transfer of assets - are not enough on their own"
157,"Therefore, there is no co-entrepreneurship if the spouse working in the company - possibly"
158,surrenders property belonging to him to the other spouse for use on the basis of an employment contract
159,"IV Transfer of an agricultural and forestry operation by way of anticipated succession1 Transfer of the operation with all essential operating principles If a taxpayer transfers the agricultural and forestry operation as a whole to a successor free of charge, Section 7 (1) EStDV shall apply"
160,The hidden reserves contained in the business assets cannot be realized
161,"If the agricultural and forestry business transferred to the successor was leased in its entirety at the time of the transfer without an operational cessation having been declared, Section 7 (1) EStDV can also be applied"
162,"2 Retention of company buildings or individual property areas a) If a taxpayer transfers the agricultural and forestry operations to a successor free of charge, but retains the company building, Section 7 (1) EStDV does not apply because the essential principles of the operation are not transferred to the successor"
163,"In addition to the land, the essential operating principles of an agricultural and forestry business also include the operating buildings and, as a rule, the living and dead inventory"
164,"If the company building is retained, a company as a whole is not transferred"
165,"Since only individual economic goods are handed over free of charge, while the company building is taken over into private assets, there is an operational cessation within the meaning of Section 16 (3) EStG (Section 139 (5) EStR)"
166,"b) If, in the case of a free transfer of business, not business buildings, but rather individual land areas that are to be treated as agricultural operations (because they cover more than 3,000 square meters) are retained for own management, Section 7 (1) EStDV can be applied if the retained land is in proportion are of subordinate importance to the transferred farm and the successor can continue the transferred farm as a living organism without new acquisitions"
167,Example: The farm is operated on 9 hectares of land
168,Buildings and inventory are available
169,The taxpayer transfers the business to the son and retains 4000 square meters
170,"The matter is to be judged differently if no business within the meaning of Section 7 (1) EStDV, but only individual assets were transferred"
171,Example: A taxpayer has two plots of land that are 4000 square meters or
172,6000 square meters
173,He manages it himself
174,"He donates the 6000 square meter property to his son, he continues to cultivate the 4000 square meter property himself"
175,The area retained is not of minor importance in relation to the area transferred
176,"No agricultural operation as a whole, but only a single asset is transferred"
177,There is a withdrawal
178,The retained property is an agricultural operation and therefore business assets
179,"c) If a farmer transfers his agricultural and forestry operations to a successor free of charge and retains land areas of less than 3,000 square meters for his own management, the simplification rule (see No. 3 of the decree of 3 5 1972) cannot be applied against the will of the taxpayer become"
180,Therefore the farmer must be given the right to choose
181,He can choose whether he wants to transfer the retained land into private assets or not
182,"If the farmer declares that he has transferred the retained areas of less than 3000 square meters to private property, the hidden reserves contained in the transferred areas must be discovered"
183,This is where a free transfer of business within the meaning of Section 7 (1) EStDV and a tax-favored tax benefit under Section 14 34 EStG come together (Section 139 (5) EStR)
184,"If, on the other hand, the farmer expressly declares that he has not transferred the retained land to private property, this continues to constitute an agricultural and forestry operation"
185,"In addition, there is a free transfer of business in accordance with Section 7 (1) EStDV"
186,"If the agricultural and forestry use of all areas belonging to the business (including those previously leased) is finally and objectively ceased, this is to be seen as a conclusive treatment of the business end without the need for a special declaration of abandonment"
187,"If operations were discontinued before 17/1970, the hidden reserves, insofar as they relate to the land, remain tax-free"
188,"If the company was discontinued after 1 7 1970 but before 1 7 1972, the rule contained in No. 11 of the decree of 10 3 1972 must generally be followed"
189,"If a farmer and forester leased all of the land to several tenants before 1 7 1970, then he regularly gave up his business before 1 7 1970"
190,A special declaration of responsibility is not required in these cases
191,"On July 1, 1970, the plots belong to private assets"
192,A continuation of the operation with the result that the lease income is to be treated as income from agriculture and forestry can only be accepted as an exception if the leasing of the individual areas is based on special circumstances and the lessor intends to resume operations and this possibility is sufficiently secured
193,2 Business leasing a) General The leasing of an agricultural and forestry business as a whole can be permitted according to the decree of 17 12 1965 - III-B / II-Tgb
194,"No. 512/65 - S-2140 A communicated by order of 28 12 1965 S-2140 - 16 - St 221 (lease decree) can only be accepted if the essential operating principles (operation with buildings, land and dead and living inventory) are as be leased as a single whole"
195,The taxpayer has the option of ceasing to operate either at the beginning of the lease or at any later point in time
196,"If the company was operated by several people, the declaration of duties must be submitted uniformly by all those involved"
197,"According to the decree of 10 3 1972 No. 6, in the cases of company leasing mentioned there, in which the lease income was treated as income from renting and leasing in the legally binding assessment for 1969, it can be assumed that the company was closed before 17 1970"
198,"For reasons of the protection of legitimate expectations, this also applies if the lease income was declared in the 1969 income tax return as income from renting and leasing, but the tax office did not carry out an assessment and a declaration of discontinuation of operation possible according to No. 4 of the decree of 3 5 1972 was not submitted"
199,"b) Withdrawal of individual pieces of land If an agricultural and forestry business is leased while the business is being continued, the land belonging to the landlord and leased are necessary business assets"
200,"Their removal is therefore only possible if they leave the leased business, i"
201,are no longer co-leased due to a change in the lease agreement
202,"If the land that belongs to the lessor and which is also leased is sold, then they are removed from the business assets of the lessor through the sale"
203,c) Retention of individual pieces of land If a farmer and forester who leases his business as a whole retains land areas for further management that are of minor importance in relation to the total area (e.g.
204,"6000 square meters are retained from a total area of ​​10 hectares), then this is entirely harmless for the acceptance of a business lease"
205,"Since - as already stated in II - every small area can, strictly speaking, represent an agricultural and forestry operation, two agricultural and forestry operations were created by leasing the operation to the exclusion of individual areas"
206,"On the one hand, there is a lease of the business as a whole (with the option of explaining the task or continuing the operation), on the other hand, the retained area forms a separate agricultural and forestry operation"
207,"From this, in turn, individual areas can be leased permanently and therefore - as explained in II 2 - removed"
208,"If the retained area is no more than 3000 square meters, no more agricultural and forestry operations exist according to No. 3 of the decree of 3 5 1972"
209,"Since the area was previously a business asset, the farmer cannot be forced to transfer it to private assets when the lease begins"
210,The farmer is to be given the right to choose whether he wants to keep the area in the business assets or remove it
211,"If the area remains business assets, the case must be specially monitored in the future, since in the event of a sale in view of the 3000 square meter regulation, it could be overlooked that it is agricultural business assets"
212,"If the farmer transfers the retained area when leasing the business or at a later point in time into private assets, the resulting profit is favored according to Sections 14 and 34 of the Income Tax Act, as the self-cultivated area is now being closed down"
213,"Were the retained assets an essential operating basis, e.g."
214,"the farm building or a large cultivation area, the lease waiver cannot be applied"
215,"It concerns the leasing of individual assets of the continuing operation, which the taxpayer can permanently withdraw in the case of a lease or remain in his business assets"
216,The leased land can also remain in the business assets of taxpayers who determine their profit in accordance with Section 4 (3) EStG or the GDL
217,"In the case of these taxpayers, according to Section 14 (6) of the Income Tax Act 1972, voluntary business assets are not considered"
218,"Since the land was originally part of the business assets, according to Section 14, Paragraph 13 of the 1972 Income Tax Act, it can only be removed from the business assets through a clear removal process"
219,"Examples: a) A farmer (part-time) has an area of ​​8,000 square meters"
220,"He leases 4,000 square meters of this on a permanent basis, and manages the remaining 4,000 square meters himself"
221,He can choose whether he wants to leave the leased 4000 sqm in his business assets or remove it
222,"If he withdraws the leased 4000 sqm, the withdrawal profit is current profit (no discount according to §§ 14 34 EStG)"
223,"The remaining 4000 square meters, which he manages himself, are still a business"
224,b) A farmer has an area of ​​6000 square meters
225,He leases 4000 square meters on a permanent basis and continues to manage 2000 square meters himself
226,The taxpayer can leave the leased 4000 square meters in his business assets or withdraw it
227,"If he removes the leased 4000 square meters, he in turn has the right to choose whether he wants to transfer the remaining 2000 square meters into his private assets or leave them as business assets"
228,"If he leaves the remaining 2000 square meters in business assets, a withdrawal profit belongs to the possibly"
229,4000 sqm withdrawn to current profit and is not favored according to §§ 14 34 EStG
230,"However, if he transfers the entire area into his private assets, the total profit is favored according to §§ 14 34 EStG (business closure)"
231,"d) Lease of piece lands If a taxpayer only owns a piece of land which, apart from the 3000 sqm rule, represents an agricultural and forestry operation, and if he has leased this piece land on a permanent basis, one would have to come to the conclusion when applying the lease decree that the piece land is a continued operation of agriculture and forestry if the taxpayer has not submitted a declaration of abandonment"
232,"In this regard, the view must be taken that the lease decree is not to be applied without restriction to piece land"
233,An agricultural and forestry business in the whole of i
234,"of the lease decree can only be a business with buildings and inventory, since only such a business can be continued as a living organism by a tenant without new acquisitions"
235,"If such a piece of land was leased before July 1, 1970, it belonged to the taxpayer's private assets on that date and is not subject to land gain taxation when it is sold"
236,"If a piece of land was leased after 30 6 1970, then this lease can regularly be seen as a cessation of operation"
237,"However, the taxpayer cannot be prevented from continuing the piece landings as business assets even after the lease"
238,"If he declares that he wants to continue the business, the tax case must be specially monitored in the future, since in the event of a later sale, a taxable profit may arise, which is beneficiary according to §§ 14 34 EStG"
239,"If a taxpayer leases all of his previously agriculturally used land to several tenants and he no longer operates agriculture or forestry himself, an operational cessation is i"

242,A special declaration of responsibility is not required
243,VI Determination of the book values ​​of the land according to § 55 Paragraph 1 to 4 EStG1 General Reference is made to the wording of § 55 Paragraph 1 to 4 EStG and to No. 10 of the decree of 10 3 1972
244,2 starting amounts according to § 55 para 2 no
245,"1 and 2 to 8 EStG in cases in which the actual use on July 1, 1970 deviates from the use entered in the real estate cadastre"
246,"If the taxpayer proves that the actual use of areas on July 1, 1970 deviates from the use entered in the real estate cadastre, and if there are no yield indicators for these areas in the real estate cadastre, the starting amount must be determined in accordance with Section 55 (3) EStG"
247,The aforementioned legal provision regulates the cases mentioned conclusively
248,A later correction of the thus determined starting amounts after carrying out the land appraisal and determining the yield figures is not possible (see No. 10 Paragraph 9 of the decree of 10 3 1972)

250,§ 86 AO possible) at the company tax office
251,"Evidence can be provided in different ways: reference to comparable property sales, to a development plan existing on 1 July 1970, appraisal of the municipality"
252,"For further details, reference is made to No. 11 of the decree of 10 3 1972 and the decree of 9 6 1972"
253,2 Simplification regulation In No. 11 of the decree of 10 3 1972 it was determined that in the case of sales or withdrawals before 1 7 1972 it can be assumed that the partial value of the land on 1 7 1970 is usually the sale price or
254,"The withdrawal value corresponds, unless special circumstances (cf. decree of 9 6 1972) have led to a significant increase in value"
255,Such value-increasing circumstances always exist when the sales price or
256,the withdrawal value by more than 30%
257,deviates upwards from the partial value on 1 7 1970
258,"This also applies to business sales or business closures before 1 7 1972. If the simplification rule comes into play, a formal determination of the higher partial value (in the amount of the sales proceeds minus the sales costs or sales costs) can be made in sales or withdrawal cases up to 30 6 1972"
259,the withdrawal value)
260,But this has to be put on record
261,"3 Effects of the determination on other types of tax The determination of a higher partial value for the land can, according to Section 69 (4) BewG (from 1 1 1974), mean that the property must be added to the real estate in the course of a subsequent determination (e.g."
262,if arable land became building land)
263,"This subsequent assessment has effects in individual cases on the property tax, u"
264,Property tax and inheritance tax
265,"However, the attribution to agricultural and forestry assets does not change if the increase in value is based on reasons that are to be sought in the agricultural sector"
266,"VIII Loss clause The loss clause of Section 55, Paragraph 6 of the Income Tax Act is intended to prevent book losses, which arise due to the application of the flat-rate value above the partial value, from reducing profits"
267,"Thereafter, losses may not be taken into account if the selling price after deducting the selling costs is less than twice the starting amount"
268,The prohibition of deductions also applies to partial value depreciation (see No. 13 of the decree of 10 3 1972)
269,Example: Double the starting amount 5000 DM Sale price 3000 DM The loss of 2000 DM is not deductible according to Section 55 (6) EStG
270,IX Book and value recording of the land1 What is the value recording of the land for taxpayers with profit determination according to §§ 4 Abs 1 4 Abs 3 EStG or
271,"when determining profits in accordance with the GDL (§ 13a EStG) is to be observed in general, results from the decree of 10 3 1972 on the statements in nos"
272,1 2 and 12 of the decree are pointed out
273,"In deviation from No. 1 (3) of the decree of 10 3 1972, the property belonging to the business assets is in the balance sheets, which are drawn up on a key date after 30 12 1975 (previously 30 12 1973), with the values ​​according to § 55 EStG to be shown"
274,"2 Paragraph 55 of the EStG only applies in cases in which the land was part of the fixed assets by the end of June 30, 1970"
275,"If land is only acquired after June 30, 1970, the land must be capitalized at the cost of acquisition"
276,"If land is laid, the deposit is to be assessed at the partial value"
277,Deposits are to be carried at the most at the acquisition or production costs if the inserted asset was purchased within the last three years prior to the contribution
278,"If the land was acquired as private assets before 6/30/1970 and deposited after 6/30/1970 and within the three-year period, the deposit is double the starting amount according to § 55 Paragraph 1 to 4 EStG or the higher partial value according to § 55 Paragraph 5 EStG to be assessed if these values ​​are higher than the acquisition costs"
279,The use of these values ​​is justified because increases in land value that occurred prior to 1 7 1970 cannot be recorded by the land gain taxation
280,"X Taxation of land gains1 In the case of profit determination according to § 4 Paragraph 3 EStG and § 12 GDL (§ 13a EStG) with payment in installments According to § 4 Paragraph 3 Sentence 4 EStG in the version of the Second Tax Amendment Act 1971, the acquisition or manufacturing costs for non-depreciable assets are fixed assets to be taken into account as a business expense only at the time of the sale or removal of these assets"
281,"If the entire selling price does not flow in the year of the sale, but - as is the case in particular with installment payments - at a later point in time, the taxpayer has the right to choose whether to consider the acquisition costs at the time of the sale of the property as operating expenses (Section 4 Para 3 sentence 4 EStG) and record the sales proceeds at the inflow (Section 11 (1) sentence 1 EStG) or whether he wants to tax the sales gain only at the point in time at which the sales proceeds exceed the acquisition costs"
282,The right to choose applies both to the determination of profits in accordance with Section 4 (3) EStG and to the determination of a profit surcharge in accordance with Section 12 (4) no
283,3 GDL and is also relevant in those cases in which the property was part of the fixed assets on 1 7 1970 and was valued at twice the starting amount or the higher partial value
284,"Summarizing example: A farmer who bought the property in 1973 for 70,000 DM and sells it in 1978 for 150,000 DM agrees with the buyer that the purchase price is to be paid in five annual installments of 30,000 DM each beginning in 1979"
285,"The farmer has the following options: operating income 1978 0 operating expenses 1978 DM 70,000 = 70,000 DM loss operating income 1979 DM 30,000 operating expenses 1979 0 = 30,000 DM profit 1980 to 1983 as 1979 or: operating income 1979 DM 30,000 operating expenses 1979 DM 30,000 = 01 980 as 1979 operating income 1981 DM 30,000 operating expenses 1981 DM 10,000 = DM 20,000 Profit operating income 1982 DM 30,000 operating expenses 1982 0 = DM 30,000 profit 1983 as in 19822 In the case of structural change between the views of the I and IV Senate of the BFH on the question of how the book approach ""Land is to be treated when a commercial enterprise through a structural change to an agricultural and forestry one Operation becomes (or vice versa) ""there was a fundamental difference (see FMS decree of 30 5 1974 B / II - 973/74 - S-2135 A, announced by order of 20 6 1974 S-2135 - 30 - St 221 -)"
286,"By resolution of October 7, 1974, BStBl 1975 p"
287,168 the legal questions submitted to him were decided as follows: 1 The structural change of a horticultural company from a commercial enterprise with profit determination according to § 5 EStG to an agricultural enterprise with profit determination according to § 4 para 1 EStG a
288,is not a removal of the land used for the business from the commercial business assets
289,"2 In the event of a structural change of the type described, the hidden reserves contained in the book approach for the land are not to be dissolved either from the point of view of an operational discontinuation or for any other reason"
290,XI Exemptions according to §§ 14 14a EStG1 General The exemption according to § 14 EStG has been increased from the assessment period 1971 in accordance with the amendment of § 16 para 4 EStG
291,"In addition, § 14a EStG was inserted"
292,"According to this, special allowances are granted for certain sales transactions between July 1, 1970 and December 31, 1973"
293,"For details, please refer to nos"

297,"presupposes that the unit value of the business applicable at the time of the sale is 25,000 DM or"
298,"Does not exceed 30,000 DM (see Section 14a Paragraph 1 in conjunction with"
299,of the Second Tax Amendment Act 1973 of 18 7 1974 a
300,"It is of the opinion that in the case of leased holdings, the determination of the unit value limit is not based on the total unit value, but rather on the lessor's share for the lessor and on the lessee's share of the unit value for the lessee"
301,The unit value limit can only meaningfully relate to what the farmer and forestry owner who wants to claim the tax allowance can sell in a legally permissible manner
302,"b) Application of Section 14a, Paragraph 3 of the Income Tax Act (EStG) in cases of lease The business is also considered to be sold if a tenant or other beneficial owner hands over the agricultural and forestry business to the owner for the purpose of structural improvement (cf. decree of 15 3 1973 - B / II- 402/73 - S-2239 A, announced by order of 28 3 1973 S-2239 3 St 221)"
303,c) Repayment of debts of another agricultural and forestry enterprise According to § 14a Abs 4 EStG an allowance is granted if only part of the land belonging to an agricultural and forestry enterprise is sold
304,The prerequisite for the granting of the exemption is
305,that the sale price will be used to pay off debts of the agricultural and forestry business within six months of the sale
306,"The tax exemption is only to be granted if the debts of the agricultural and forestry company, whose business assets included the property sold, are repaid"
307,The repayment of debts of another company of the same taxpayer is not tax-favored according to the wording of § 14a EStG
308,d) Compensation for deviating heirs within the meaning of Section 14a Paragraph 4 EStG
309,are granted if the sale price is used to compensate for heirs within six months of the sale
310,"This requirement is fulfilled if co-heirs are compensated due to an inheritance dispute, a person entitled to a compulsory portion is paid out or a legatee who would be entitled to inheritance according to the legal succession receives a legacy"
311,"Other legatees, on the other hand, cannot be regarded as heirs giving way within the meaning of this provision"
312,e) Effect of the application for the granting of an exemption within the meaning of Section 14a (4) of the Income Tax Act
313,"of § 14a Paragraph 4 EStG, which is part of current profit in the case of a business year deviating from the calendar year according to § 2 Paragraph 6 no"
314,1 sentence 1 EStG (§ 4a Paragraph 2 No.
315,1 sentence 1 EStG 1975) on a pro rata basis
316,The same applies to the exemption amount i
317,of § 14a Paragraph 4 EStG (No. 8 Paragraph 6 of the Decree of 10 3 1972)
318,The exemption is only granted on application
319,The request relates to the entire capital gain
320,"Therefore, even if the tax exemption is distributed over two calendar years, only one application is required"
321,A limitation of the application to the pro-rata capital gain of a calendar year is not considered admissible
322,"f) Offsetting of the tax allowance according to § 14a Abs 4 EStG when applying the concessions according to §§ 6b, 6c EStG If the tax relief according to § 14a Abs 4 EStG is used for a capital gain, § 6b or"

326,"h) Further requirements for the granting of the tax exemption according to § 14a Abs 4 EStG for sales of land after December 31, 1973 and before December 1, 1977 (Second Tax Amendment Act 1973)"
327,The granting of the tax exemption according to § 14a Paragraph 4 i
328,"of the Second Tax Amendment Act 1973 for sales after December 31, 1973 depends u"
329,"also on the amount of income (24,000 or"
330,"48,000 DM) without taking into account the tax exemption (see letter e) in the assessment period prior to the sale"
331,Example: Preliminary remark: It is assumed that the taxpayer is assessed together with his spouse according to § 26 26b EStG
332,"The profit determined in accordance with Section 4 (1) of the EStG for the 1973/74 financial year is DM 52,000. This profit includes a profit of DM 42,000 from the sale of land belonging to the business assets in March 1974"
333,The taxpayer applies for an exemption in accordance with Section 14a (4) EStG in the amount of the capital gain
334,The prerequisites of § 14a para 4 no
335,1 EStG are available
336,"The income from 1973, which is decisive for granting the tax exemption, is made up as follows: Income from agriculture and forestry a) pro rata profit for the 1972/73 financial year DM 7,000 b) pro rata profit in the 1973/74 financial year DM 26,000 c) other income DM 13,000 DM 46,000 DM"
337,"Exemption according to Section 13 (3) EStG DM 2,400 Total income DM 43,600"
338,"Special expenses 3,600 DM Income 40,000 DM without deduction of the pro rata tax exemption according to § 14a Paragraph 4 EStG of 21,000 DM"
339,"Since the relevant income does not exceed the limit of 48,000 DM, the exemption according to § 14a Ab"
340,"4 EStG of a total of DM 42,000"
341,"The tax exemption is to be taken into account in the assessments for 1973 and 1974 with DM 21,000 each when determining income from agriculture and forestry"
342,"i) Granting of the exemption according to § 14a Abs 4 EStG in the case of the uniform and separate determination of the income from agriculture and forestry If the income from agriculture and forestry is determined uniformly and separately, the time of the respective sale is also included in the notification of assessment for the first time for 1973 as well as the profits according to § 14a Abs 4 EStG especially for the calendar year in which the financial year begins and for the calendar year in which the financial year ends"
343,"XII Implementation of the taxation of land gains The processing of sales and withdrawals, which are to be checked for tax liability according to § 55 EStG, is often very laborious and time-consuming, especially since the taxpayers often do not cooperate sufficiently"
344,"In the interest of simplifying work and speeding up processing, I therefore agree that in cases in which agricultural land has been sold, the following procedure will be followed: 1 If the sale price is not more than double the starting amount (Section 55 (1) EStG), there is nothing to be done"
345,"The notification of sale must be filed with a corresponding note, which is signed by the department head"
346,"Provided that for each municipality (in the case of larger municipalities for each district) the lowest double the starting amount (the yield figure multiplied by eight) for agricultural areas is determined and the sub-districts responsible for processing the land gain taxation for farmers and foresters are disclosed, in individual cases the determination of double the starting amount can also be refrained from, provided that the selling price does not exceed the lowest double starting amount determined for the respective municipality (district)"
347,I would therefore ask you to check whether it is appropriate to determine the lowest double the starting amount from this point of view
348,"2 If the sale price exceeds twice the starting amount, a distinction must be made as to whether the sale took place before 1 7 1972 or after"
349,"a) Sale before July 1, 1972 aa) If the findings of the tax office show that the selling price of the property corresponds to the partial value on July 1, 1970, there will be no profit when carrying out the assessment procedure according to Section 55 (5) of the Income Tax Act (EStG) If there is no tax interest, this determination must be put on record on the notification of sale and finally signed by the department head"
350,"In this case, the taxpayer can in principle dispense with the implementation of a determination procedure in accordance with Section 55 (5) EStG and the submission of the necessary application"
351,"Likewise, in these cases, the often time-consuming investigations into whether the sold agriculturally used property is business or private property can be omitted"
352,"However, if the taxpayer has submitted an application to determine the higher partial value, the determination procedure must be carried out in accordance with Section 55 (5) EStG"
353,"bb) If, due to special circumstances, it can be assumed that the selling price exceeds the higher partial value of the land on 1 7 1970, I would ask the taxpayer to first inform the taxpayer of the right to apply under Section 55 (5) EStG"

363,Questionnaire I is intended for the evaluation of the notices of sale
364,Questionnaire II is to be used in those cases in which Stpfl or their advisors have submitted so-called statements of responsibility or other notifications about the fact that land belongs to private assets
365,The correspondence arising in this connection must be filed in the standard value files of the relevant tax authority in all cases that are not kept for income tax purposes

381,2 Type of profit determination The profit from viticulture of the winegrowers who are neither obliged to keep accounts nor submit an application according to § 13a Paragraph 1 Sentence 2 EStG is to be determined for the 1974/75 financial year according to § 13a Paragraph 2 - 6 EStG if there is a basic amount according to § 13a Paragraph 3 EStG of more than DM 0 (see Section 127 Paragraph 4 EStER 1975)

392,"However, the provision of § 13a EStG does not apply if only viticulture is practiced and the comparative value of this use, taking into account the values ​​of possible leases and leases, is over DM 4000"
393,The new regulation of the taxation of non-bookkeeping farmers and foresters made by Section 13a of the Income Tax Act does not result in any fundamental change in the procedure for determining the profit from viticulture

395,"1 EStG, the income (= profit) from viticulture to be recorded - as before - is to be determined by comparing operating income and operating expenses"
396,"Operating income is all income that accrues to the company from the utilization of the harvest (grapes, mash, must and wine), the by-products (pomace, brandy, yeast) as well as from the utilization of a tax-free purchase of third-party products and any auxiliary business of the wine-growing company including grants and products withdrawn from the business for private living"
397,"Operating expenses are all expenses incurred through the cultivation of the vineyards, in particular through the development, the harvest and through the expansion and sale of the products"
398,When determining the operating expenses - as before - a distinction must be made between the real construction costs and the wage expenses
399,3 Recording of operating income Complete recording of operating income is only guaranteed if the harvest yields are reliably determined

406,b) The lump sums to compensate for the actual building costs are based on the size of the survey farms on the circumstances of smaller non-bookkeeping farms

418,"The building costs framework rates correspond to the expenditures of all municipalities summarized in the respective building cost group, namely both the municipalities with the highest building costs and the municipalities whose costs do not exceed the lowest framework"
419,The framework rates are to be applied in such a way that the tax offices after careful and expert examination - if necessary
420,"in consultation with the agricultural auditors who carried out the surveys in the individual municipalities - determine the corresponding flat rate for each individual municipality belonging to the building cost group, which within the framework rate best does justice to the building costs of this municipality"
421,"In order to avoid inconveniences, it seems advisable that, because of the determination of the lump sums for neighboring wine-growing communities with not significantly different cost structures in different tax office districts, these neighboring tax offices coordinate with each other in good time"
422,"If the building costs for the individual municipalities have been adjusted and determined in this way, I ask that professional representatives as official experts (about 2 to 3 representatives) to hear about the intended determinations without incurring costs for the financial administration"
423,"If the representatives of the viticulture do not give their consent, although according to the operational structure and the actual circumstances, in particular according to the established development costs, a higher than the planned flat rate is not justified for the wine-growing community in question, the tax office has the construction costs flat rate for this To determine the community itself"
424,The flat rates are to be set in the form of a list with the following header: Wine-growing community-specific costs The flat rate for building costs determined in this way is for the assessment of all winegrowers (with profit determination according to § 13a Paragraph 6 No.

428,"If, instead of the previous framework rates, only a uniform flat rate has been set, a corresponding report template can be dispensed with"
429,"The flat rates include all material costs of the management including the depreciation on the depreciable assets and on the vineyards, the maintenance and repair costs and the vine replacement as well as the pressing and cellar costs (material costs of the cellar building and the storage barrels or"
430,"Storage tanks), with the exception of: a) the sugaring costs, expansion costs and sales costs, b) the contributions for the insurance of the vines against hail damage, c) the reallocation costs of vineyard land within the scope of land consolidation, d) the rent on the wine-growing property, e ) the contributions for the construction of new vineyard roads, which are levied on the basis of an official contribution statute that complies with the provisions of the municipal tax law, f) the expenses for own systems for frost control in accordance with § 7 EStG and the contributions to soil and water associations that for the sprinkling of vineyards, g) the debt interest including the interest due to the HGA, insofar as it relates to the installation assets, h) the sales tax amounts (payment burden) according to the UStG 1967i) the flat rate for increased depreciation due to phylloxera contamination in accordance with the following paragraph 5The expenses listed under letters a - i are above the flat rate to compensate for the material costs, deductible in the amount documented in the ""Viticulture Annex"" for the income tax return in addition to the flat rate for building costs"

435,") In addition, a special lump sum, which the individual tax office has to determine uniformly for its district, must be taken into account"
436,"5 Increased depreciation due to phylloxera contamination In the case of real-root vines (not for grafted vines) in phylloxera-infested communities, in addition to the general lump sums for material costs, a lump sum for increased depreciation is deductible due to the resulting shortening of the useful life"
437,"However, the useful life of the vines ends as soon as the vines have been cut"
438,A depreciation is therefore no longer permitted from this point on
439,"The lump sum is also out of the question for the fallow field, because after cutting these areas there are no more vines whose productivity (useful life) is reduced"
440,"The occurrence of phylloxera in the contaminated wine-growing communities (Annex 2 + 3), regardless of whether they are heavily or weakly contaminated, is taken into account by a uniform extraordinary depreciation"
441,The lump sum for this increased depreciation is - as before - DM 300 per hectare
442,"a) First detection of phylloxera contamination (initial contamination) Based on the underlying remaining useful life of 12 years, the increased depreciation for the affected vineyards can only be considered for 12 financial years from the year of official recognition as a phylloxera-contaminated municipality"
443,"After that, for the Wj"
444,1974/75 the increased depreciation is only deductible if recognition as a congregation contaminated with phylloxera did not take place before 1963
445,"In Annex 2, the phylloxera-infested communities are listed with the year of the first recognition of phylloxera and the financial year for which an increased depreciation is to be applied for the last time"
446,"b) Renewed detection of phylloxera contamination In numerous wine-growing communities in the Mosel-Saar-Ruwer growing area, phylloxera infection was again detected in individual plots in later years after the initial contamination of the district (reference to the compilation in Appendix 3)"
447,"If the twelve-year period has already expired since the first contamination (see letter a), a further increased AfA can be claimed for the vineyards of the plots immediately re-contaminated with phylloxera for a period of no more than 12 years after the re-establishment of phylloxera contamination, provided the following conditions are met: 1 The taxpayers submit the notification of the phylloxera commissioner, which shows when and immediately in which parcels again phylloxera contamination was found"
448,2 The taxpayers provide suitable documents to prove that measures against renewed phylloxera contamination have resulted in additional expenses
449,The wine-growing communities listed in both overviews (Annex 2 and 3) have been specially marked (++)
450,"Insofar as in these cases the 1974/75 financial year lies in the twelve-year period of both the first contamination and the renewed contamination, only the conditions required under letter a are required for the application of the lump sum for the increased depreciation"
451,6 Wage expenses The wage expenses for employees working in an employment relationship are generally only deductible as business expenses in the amount documented by the taxpayer
452,"It should be noted, however, that when determining the profit from viticulture within the framework of § 13a Paragraph 6 No."
453,"1 EStG, only the wage expenses in addition to the flat rates to compensate for the material costs are to be taken into account, which are caused by the viticulture"

886,"The usual permanent loads on the farm, such as the dike and sill loads (incl"
887,the contributions to the water and soil associations) as well as the real estate tax burden have already been taken into account in the unit assessment

1098,"The regulation of § 4 Forest Damage Compensation Act assumes that in the financial year of a logging restriction, correspondingly lower income from wood use is achieved than in normal years"
1099,"To compensate for this shortfall in income, it allows increased flat-rate operating expenses"
1100,"I am of the opinion that, according to the meaning and purpose of the regulation, the income from the use of wood as a result of a major calamity that led to the logging restriction can only be taken into account when calculating the increased operating expenses flat rates insofar as the calamity use together with the ordinary Timber use does not exceed the restricted logging limits"
1101,b) Does the income from previous financial years form part of the assessment basis for the increased flat-rate operating expenses?
1102,This question must be answered in the negative for the reasons given under item 1 above
1103,c) The increased flat rates for operating expenses are based on the income from the use of wood for all wood species groups or only the wood species group for which the logging restriction has been ordered
1104,"For the reasons mentioned under item 1 above, I ask you to take the view that the income from the use of wood of the wood species groups not affected by the logging restriction must be disregarded for the assessment of the increased operating expenses flat rates"
1105,d) Can the increased flat rates for operating expenses also be claimed by foresters who have not adhered to the felling restrictions
1106,"In cases in which the forest managers are responsible for exceeding the logging limit themselves, this question must be answered in the negative"
1107,e) To which income are the increased flat rates for operating expenses to be applied if the profit determination period deviates from the forestry year and thus from the period of the logging restriction
1108,"According to the meaning and purpose of the regulation, the period of the logging restriction is decisive"

1136,"b) In the case of farmers and foresters as well as small businesses and self-employed people, the increases in land value prior to 1 7 1970 are not taken into account when determining the profit on sale or withdrawal, even in cases in which the land was already on 30 6 1970 belonged to the business assets (§ 55 Abs 1 EStG) Example: If a small business owner sold his property belonging to the business assets before August 15, 1971, this transaction is not significant for income tax purposes"
1137,"If the land is sold after August 14, 1971, the new land gain taxation rules apply"
1138,"The increases in land value that occurred before 1 7 1970 are not to be taken into account, but the changes in value that occurred between 30 6 1970 and 15 8 1971 and up to the date of sale are to be taken into account"
1139,"3 Determination of advance payments In significant cases, the land gains resulting from the sale of real estate are not to be recorded in the context of the assessment, but by adjusting the current advance payments or by subsequently increasing the advance payment"
1140,I Concept of agricultural and forestry operations1 Serious agricultural and forestry activities The concept of agricultural and forestry operations does not require a minimum size or the affiliation of farm buildings and resources
1141,The serious agricultural use of individual agricultural properties is therefore also agriculture and forestry
1142,"According to No. 3 of the decree of 3 5 1972, for reasons of administrative simplification, it can generally be assumed that - apart from the so-called"
1143,"Intensive use (vegetable, flower and ornamental plant cultivation, tree nurseries, viticulture, hops, asparagus and tobacco cultivation, fruit cultivation) and forestry - there is no agricultural or forestry operation if the total land area under cultivation does not exceed 3000 square meters"
1144,"If, on the other hand, the self-cultivated land area is more than 3000 square meters, then there is an agricultural and forestry operation if, according to the overall picture, these areas are used seriously for agricultural purposes"
1145,"Indications for serious agricultural use can be the scope of the work, the use of machines and devices as well as the ongoing fertilization and spraying of the crops"
1146,"Membership in an agricultural professional organization, membership in agricultural purchasing and sales cooperatives, the payment of contributions to the agricultural retirement fund, the use of cheaper gas oil and other government measures to improve the agricultural structure can all contribute to the existence of an agricultural and forestry business speak"
1147,Agricultural use also exists if the products are only used for personal consumption
1148,"In this case, however, serious use cannot be assumed on a regular basis because of the assumed low profitability"
1149,Are areas only managed in the interests of landscape protection (e.g.
1150,"mowed by the owner or a third party), it can no longer be considered serious agricultural and forestry activity"
1151,"If these principles are applied, private house gardens, allotment gardens and weekend properties (see also decree of 3 5 1972) are excluded from the field of agriculture and forestry"
1152,"2 Affiliation of land to the business assets The business assets of a farmer and forest manager include: a) The self-managed land belonging to the business owner; economic ownership is sufficient (see Section III No. 2), b) leased land, c) the low-lying land (Section 44 BewG), e.g."
1153,"Heathland, d) Unland (Section 45 BewG), e.g."
1154,"Moats and embankments, e) fallow land (social fallow land): this is land that is temporarily not cultivated for personal or economic reasons"
1155,"Regarding b) If individual properties of the remaining business are temporarily leased, they remain necessary business assets"
1156,"If, on the other hand, they are leased on a long-term basis, the removal of the property can be recognized if the lease is proven (name of the lessee)"
1157,A prerequisite for a tax-recognized withdrawal is that the lease has been seriously agreed and is actually carried out (e.g.
1158,for leases between parents and children)
1159,"If the permanent lease took place before July 1, 1970 and the withdrawal was expressly declared, the land on July 1, 1970 belonged to private assets"
1160,"If the declaration has not been made, the same applies if a) at the time of the lease there was no reason for the lessor to declare the withdrawal for tax purposes (e.g. because"
1161,no assessment has been carried out) or b) the rental income has been shown in the tax return for the assessment period 1969 as income from rental and leasing
1162,"Regarding the determination of the withdrawal value in the period up to June 30, 1972, see No. 11 of the decree dated 10 3 1972 Regarding withdrawal through change in use in a profit determination method in which arbitrary business assets are not taken into account and the related transitional regulation cf. decree of 3 3 1979 announced by order dated 30 3 1979 and order dated 13 11 1981 No. 8 To e) If individual agricultural areas of an agricultural holding are not used for agricultural purposes for a certain or indefinite period, they generally remain business assets"
1163,"If a farmer finally and recognizably ceases to use individual pieces of land, these pieces of land can be removed"
1164,This can e.g.
1165,be the case if use has been discontinued due to reallocation proceedings or due to development
1166,"In addition to the cessation of use, a clear withdrawal action is required (Section 13a, Paragraph 2 of the Income Tax Regulation)"
1167,"However, the treatment of the property in the standard value method is irrelevant"
1168,If all areas of an agricultural holding are no longer used for agricultural purposes - also referred to in parlance as social fallow land - this can be a task for the holding
1169,"Are allotments, which according to"
1170,"According to Section 34 (7) BewG, which previously represented an independent operation, was permanently fallow, one can no longer speak of a serious agricultural and forestry activity"
1171,They therefore belong to private assets from the time of cessation of use
1172,This also applies if a third party looks after the area (e.g.
1173,mows down)
1174,The cessation of use will regularly be associated with an operational cessation (see Section V)
1175,3 Heritable building right The encumbrance of a property belonging to a business asset with a heritable building right does not in itself constitute a withdrawal
1176,Land belonging to an agricultural and forestry business asset and which was encumbered with a heritable building right prior to 1 7 1970 therefore still belonged to the property owner's agricultural and forestry business assets on 1 7 1970
1177,"Something different only applies if the owner sold his business before 17 1970 without the property encumbered with the heritable building right, gave up his business or removed the property"
1178,"If there was neither a sale of a business, nor a cessation of business, nor a withdrawal before 1 7 1970, for reasons of the protection of legitimate expectations in accordance with the administrative instruction contained in No. 6 (1) of the decree of 10 3 1972, a withdrawal can be assumed before 1 7 1970 if the ground rent was treated as income from renting and leasing in the final assessment of the property owner for the assessment period 1969"
1179,"Usufruct If a right of usufruct is ordered for an agricultural and forestry operation, the land belonging to the agricultural and forestry operation is generally to be assigned to the legal owner (usufructuary orderer)"
1180,Something else only applies if the usufructuary is to be regarded as the beneficial owner of the property as an exception (see also Section III No. 2)
1181,The same applies when ordering a usufruct on individual agricultural and forestry properties
1182,"Examples of the 3000 sqm regulation a) Several piece lands of a taxpayer The 3000 sqm limit does not refer to the individual piece land, but to all land areas of a taxpayer"
1183,b) Lots of land belonging to a community of heirs
1184,"The decisive factor is therefore not the size of the parts of the property attributable to the individual participants, but the size of the entire agricultural holding"
1185,"c) Application of the 3000 sqm regulation A taxpayer owns the following properties: aa) 2000 sqm arable land, 1500 sqm weekend property The weekend property is part of private assets"
1186,"Since the arable land is no larger than 3000 square meters, it also counts as private assets"
1187,"bb) 500 sqm vineyard area 2000 sqm arable area the 3000 sqm regulation does not apply, since there is already an agricultural and forestry operation with regard to the vineyard area and therefore the arable area also represents business assets"
1188,cc) 500 square meters of fallow vineyards (owner-occupied) 2000 square meters of harvested vineyards (owner-occupied) 1600 square meters of forest (owner-occupied) 1500 square meters of tree meadow (owner-occupied) 1200 square meters of tree meadow leased for 120 DM per year
1189,"In this case, the area used by the owner (including the fallow vineyards, the forest and the tree meadow) is larger than 3000 square meters"
1190,All of these areas belong to the agricultural business assets
1191,It can only be doubted how the leased meadow is to be treated
1192,"If it was already leased permanently on July 1, 1970, and the removal of the meadow was expressly declared before July 1, 1970, or if the lease income was declared in the 1969 income tax return as income from renting and leasing, then there are no concerns Accepting private assets (see Section V 2 a))"
1193,"If, on the other hand, the meadow is only now leased on a long-term basis, there may be a withdrawal with the result that profit is realized (see Section II 2 to b))"
1194,"Insofar as vineyards are listed in the above examples, the decision is to be applied accordingly to other intensively used areas"
1195,III Land used for agriculture and forestry in civil-law ownership of spouses and children1 General Land and forestry-use areas are part of the business assets of an agriculture and forestry sector if they are the civil-legal or economic property of the owner
1196,Land that belongs to the business owner's spouse is therefore not part of the business owner's business assets
1197,2 Economic ownership Economic ownership exists if the legal owner can be permanently excluded from affecting the economic property so that his claim to surrender no longer has any economic significance (Section 39 (2) No. 1 AO)
1198,These prerequisites will only be met in exceptional cases for the property land
1199,Such an exceptional case does not exist if one parent is in his or her
1200,their agricultural and forestry operations co-manage land that belongs to a minor child; because the parents' administrative rights over the child's property do not permanently exclude the child from affecting the property
1201,Even the free transfer of land from one spouse to the other spouse or the children to one or both parents does not constitute beneficial ownership
1202,3 Property regime Allocation of areas of the spouse to the business assets of agriculture and forestry can result from agreements under property law or from an existing corporate relationship between the spouses
1203,"In the case of the property regime of the community of property (before July 1, 1958, the property regime of the general community of property), a distinction must be made between the common property and the conditional property"
1204,"If the joint property of the spouses includes an agricultural and forestry business, according to the BFH report of 18 2 1959 BStBl III S"
1205,263 and according to the BFH judgment of 1 3 1966 BStBl III p
1206,277 to accept co-entrepreneurship between the spouses without any special agreement
1207,"In this case, all property belonging to the spouses used for agricultural and forestry purposes is part of the business assets"
1208,It does not matter whether they belong to the common property or to the conditional property of a spouse
1209,"If the land belongs to the common property, half of it is attributable to each spouse"
1210,Land belonging to a spouse's reserved property is fully attributable to this spouse
1211,"If an agricultural and forestry business is part of the property of a spouse, property managed within the framework of this business that is part of the property of the business owner is fully attributable to the owner and is business assets"
1212,Properties belonging to the other spouse's reserved property are only to be assigned to this spouse and are not part of the business owner's business assets
1213,Land belonging to the common property is to be allocated to half of each spouse and half to the business assets of the business owner
1214,The same applies to the property regime of the community of acquisitions and carriages and to the continued community of property (see BFH judgment of 2 10 1980 BStBl 1981 II p
1215,"4 Co-entrepreneurship A company relationship between spouses that has to be observed for tax purposes exists in the agricultural sector as well as in the commercial sector if both spouses actually contribute to the achievement of the company's purpose through cooperation, provision of capital or the transfer of economic goods, in particular land, as it would be the case in business with strange partners"
1216,The contribution must not be of minor importance (cf. the BFH judgment of 3 August 1973 BStBl II p
1217,844)
1218,"A company is founded by a) the express conclusion of a partnership agreement, b) the tacit behavior of the spouse, which expresses the will to conclude a partnership agreement"
1219,"In addition, cooperation and the transfer of economic goods (e.g."
1220,Land) alone is not enough
1221,"Therefore, there is no co-entrepreneurship if the spouse working in the company - possibly"
1222,"on the basis of an employment contract - lets the other spouse use the property belonging to him (for small agricultural businesses, however, see BFH of 27 2 1962 BStBl 1962 III p"
1223,214)
1224,"IV Transfer of an agricultural and forestry business by way of anticipated succession1 Transfer of the business with all essential operating principles If a taxpayer transfers the entire agricultural and forestry business to a successor free of charge, Section 7 (1) EStDV shall apply"
1225,The hidden reserves contained in the business assets cannot be realized
1226,"If the agricultural and forestry business transferred to the successor was leased in its entirety at the time of the transfer without an operational cessation having been declared, Section 7 (1) EStDV can also be applied"
1227,"If, in the case of the free transfer of an agricultural and forestry business, the transferee is obliged to give back to heirs if certain conditions apply"
1228,"Of legal age, marriage) to surrender agriculturally used land free of charge, then these land first become the property of the transferee and belong to his business assets"
1229,A withdrawal is only available when the ownership is actually transferred to the heirs who withdraw after the condition has been met
1230,"2 Retention of company buildings or individual property areas a) If a taxpayer transfers the agricultural and forestry operations to a successor free of charge, but retains the company building, Section 7 (1) EStDV does not apply because the essential principles of the operation are not transferred to the successor"
1231,"In addition to the land, the essential operating principles of an agricultural and forestry business also include the operating buildings and, as a rule, the living and dead inventory"
1232,"If the company building is retained, a company as a whole is not transferred"
1233,"Since only individual economic goods are handed over free of charge, while the company building is taken over into private assets, there is an operational cessation within the meaning of Section 16 (3) EStG (see BFH of 9 7 1981 BStBl 1982 p"
1234,"b) If, in the case of a free transfer of business, not business buildings, but rather individual land areas that are to be treated as agricultural operations (because they cover more than 3,000 square meters) are retained for own management, Section 7 (1) EStDV can be applied if the retained land is in proportion are of subordinate importance to the transferred farm and the successor can continue the transferred farm as a living organism without new acquisitions"
1235,Example: The farm is operated on 9 hectares of land
1236,Buildings and inventory are available
1237,The taxpayer transfers the business to the son and retains 4000 square meters
1238,"The matter is to be assessed differently if no business within the meaning of Section 7 (1) EStDV, but only individual assets have been transferred"
1239,Example: A taxpayer has two plots of land that are 4000 square meters or
1240,6000 square meters
1241,He manages it himself
1242,"He donates the 6000 square meter property to his son, he continues to cultivate the 4000 square meter property himself"
1243,The area retained is not of minor importance in relation to the area transferred
1244,"No agricultural operation as a whole, but only a single asset is transferred"
1245,There is a withdrawal
1246,The retained property is an agricultural operation and therefore business assets
1247,"c) If a farmer transfers his agricultural and forestry operations to a successor free of charge and retains land areas of less than 3,000 square meters for his own management, the simplification rule (see No. 3 of the decree of 3 5 1972) cannot be applied against the will of the taxpayer become"
1248,Therefore the farmer must be given the right to choose
1249,He can choose whether he wants to transfer the retained land into private assets or not (see also Section V 2 c) Paragraph 2)
1250,"If the farmer declares that he has transferred the retained areas of less than 3000 square meters to private property, the hidden reserves contained in the transferred areas must be discovered"
1251,"Here, a free transfer of business within the meaning of Section 7 (1) EStDV and a non-tax-privileged abandonment profit come together (see BFH of 19 2 1981 BStBl 1981 p"
1252,566)
1253,The previous regulation in Section 139 Paragraph 5 S
1254,4 EStR 1978 according to which in these cases a free transfer of business i
1255,"of Section 7 (1) EStDV and a tax-favored posting profit according to Sections 14 34 EStG continues to apply to transfers made up to December 31, 1981 for reasons of protection of legitimate expectations"
1256,"If, on the other hand, the farmer expressly declares that he has not transferred the retained land to private property, this continues to constitute an agricultural and forestry operation"
1257,"In addition, there is a free transfer of business in accordance with Section 7 (1) EStDV"
1258,"V The cases of the abandonment of operations in agricultural and forestry operations1 Cessation of operations If the agricultural and forestry use of all areas belonging to the operation (including those previously leased) is finally and objectively ceased, this is to be seen as a conclusive treatment of the abandonment of operations without any special treatment Declaration of duty required"
1259,"If operations were discontinued before 17/1970, the hidden reserves, insofar as they relate to the land, remain tax-free"
1260,"If the company was discontinued after 1 7 1970 but before 1 7 1972, the rule contained in No. 11 of the decree of 10 3 1972 must generally be followed"
1261,"If a farmer and forester leased all of the land to several tenants before 1 7 1970, then he regularly gave up his business before 1 7 1970"
1262,A special declaration of responsibility is not required in these cases
1263,"On July 1, 1970, the plots belong to private assets"
1264,A continuation of the operation with the result that the lease income is to be treated as income from agriculture and forestry can only be accepted as an exception if the leasing of the individual areas is based on special circumstances and the lessor intends to resume operations and this possibility is sufficiently secured
1265,2 Business leasing a) General The leasing of an agricultural and forestry business as a whole can be permitted according to the decree of 17 12 1965 - III-B / II-Tgb
1266,"No. 512/65 - S-2140 A, announced by order dated 28 12 1965 - S-2140 - 16 - St 22 1 (lease decree) can only be accepted if the essential operational principles (operation with buildings, land and dead and living Inventory) can be leased as a single whole"
1267,The taxpayer has the option of ceasing to operate either at the beginning of the lease or at any later point in time
1268,"If the company is operated by several people, the declaration of work must be submitted uniformly by all parties involved"
1269,"According to the decree of 10 3 1972 No. 6, in the cases of company leasing mentioned there, in which the lease income was treated as income from renting and leasing in the legally binding assessment for 1969, it can be assumed that the company was closed before 17 1970"
1270,"For reasons of protection of legitimate expectations, this also applies if the lease income was declared in the 1969 income tax return as income from renting and leasing, but the tax office has not carried out an assessment and a declaration of discontinuation of operation, which is possible according to No. 4 of the decree of 3 5 1972, has not been submitted"
1271,"In cases in which the agricultural and forestry operations were leased as a whole after 1 7 1970 see nos. 9 and 10 of the order of 13 11 1981 - S-2230 - 25 - St 22 2b) Removal of individual pieces of land If an agricultural and forestry operations are leased as a whole and if no declaration of abandonment is made (continuation of the previous operation by way of leasing), the leased property areas remain necessary business assets for the lessor"
1272,"Their removal is therefore only possible if they leave the leased business, i"
1273,are no longer co-leased due to a change in the lease agreement
1274,"If the land that belongs to the lessor and which is also leased is sold, then they are removed from the business assets of the lessor through the sale"
1275,c) Retention of individual pieces of land If a farmer and forester who leases his business as a whole retains land areas for further management that are of minor importance in relation to the total area (e.g.
1276,"6000 square meters are retained from a total area of ​​10 hectares), then this is entirely harmless for the acceptance of a business lease"
1277,"Since - as already stated under II - every small area can, strictly speaking, represent an agricultural and forestry operation, two agricultural and forestry operations have arisen through the leasing of the operation to the exclusion of individual areas"
1278,"On the one hand, there is a lease of the business as a whole (with the option of explaining the task or continuing the operation), on the other hand, the retained area forms a separate agricultural and forestry operation"
1279,"From this, in turn, individual areas can be leased permanently and therefore - as explained under II 2 - removed"
1280,"If the retained area is no more than 3000 square meters, no more agricultural and forestry operations exist according to No. 3 of the decree of 3 5 1972"
1281,"Since the retained area (less than 3000 square meters) was previously business assets, the farmer cannot be forced to transfer it to private assets at the start of the lease"
1282,The farmer must be given the right to choose whether he wants to keep the area as business assets or whether he wants to transfer it to private assets (see Section IV 2 c))
1283,"If the area remains business assets, the case must be specially monitored in the future, since in the event of a sale in view of the 3000 square meter regulation, it could be overlooked that it is agricultural business assets"
1284,"If the farmer transfers the retained area (less than 3000 square meters) - which forms his own agricultural and forestry business - into private assets, the resulting profit is favored according to Sections 14 and 34 of the Income Tax Act, since the self-cultivated area is now being closed down"
1285,"Were the retained assets an essential operating basis, e.g."
1286,"the farm building or a large cultivation area, the lease waiver cannot be applied"
1287,"It concerns the leasing of individual assets of the continuing operation, which the taxpayer can leave permanently in his business assets or transfer to his private assets"
1288,Leased land can also remain in business assets for taxpayers who determine their profit in accordance with Section 4 (3) EStG or according to average rates in accordance with Section 13a EStG (Section 4 (1) p
1289,4 EStG)
1290,"In the case of these taxpayers, according to Section 14 (5) EStR, arbitrary business assets are only considered in the case of a change in the type of profit calculation and a change in use"
1291,"Since the properties were originally part of the business assets, they can only be removed from the business assets according to Section 13a, Paragraph 2 of the Income Tax Regulations"
1292,Examples: aa) A farmer (part-time) has an area of ​​8000 square meters
1293,"He leases 4,000 square meters of this on a permanent basis, and manages the remaining 4,000 square meters himself"
1294,He can choose whether he wants to leave the leased 4000 sqm in his business assets or remove it
1295,"If he withdraws the leased 4000 sqm, the withdrawal profit is current profit (no discount according to §§ 14 34 EStG)"
1296,"The remaining 4000 square meters, which he manages himself, are still a business"
1297,bb) A farmer has an area of ​​6000 square meters
1298,He leases 4000 square meters on a permanent basis and continues to manage 2000 square meters himself
1299,The taxpayer can leave the leased 4000 square meters in his business assets or withdraw it
1300,"If he removes the leased 4000 square meters, he in turn has the right to choose whether he wants to transfer the remaining 2000 square meters into his private assets or leave them as business assets"
1301,"If he leaves the remaining 2000 square meters in business assets, a withdrawal profit belongs to the possibly"
1302,4000 sqm withdrawn to current profit and is not favored according to §§ 14 34 EStG
1303,"However, if he transfers the entire area into his private assets, the total profit is favored according to §§ 14 34 EStG (business closure)"
1304,"d) Lease of piece lands If a taxpayer only owns a piece of land which, apart from the 3000 sqm rule, represents an agricultural and forestry operation, and if he has leased this piece land on a permanent basis, then one would have to apply the lease decree to the The result is that piece land is a continued operation of agriculture and forestry if the taxpayer has not submitted a declaration of abandonment"
1305,"In this regard, the view must be taken that the lease decree is not to be applied without restriction to piece land"
1306,An agricultural and forestry business in the whole of i
1307,"of the lease decree can only be a business with buildings and inventory, since only such a business can be continued as a living organism by a tenant without new acquisitions"
1308,"If such a piece of land was leased before July 1, 1970, it belonged to the taxpayer's private assets on that date and is not subject to land gain taxation when it is sold"
1309,"If a piece of land was leased after 30 6 1970, this lease is basically to be seen as an operational cessation"
1310,"However, the taxpayer cannot be prevented from continuing the piece landings as business assets even after the lease"
1311,"If he declares that he wants to continue the business, the tax case must be specially monitored in the future, since in the event of a later sale, a taxable profit may arise, which is beneficiary according to §§ 14 34 EStG"
1312,"If a taxpayer leases all of his previously agriculturally used land to several tenants and he no longer operates agriculture or forestry himself, an operational cessation is i"
1313,of § 14 i
1314,Section 16 (3) EStG
1315,A special declaration of responsibility is not required
1316,With regard to the withdrawal through a change in use in a profit determination method in which the arbitrary business assets are not taken into account and the transitional regulation issued cf. decree of 15 3 1979 announced by order of 30 3 1979 and order of 13 11 1981 No. 8VI Determination of the book values ​​of the land according to § 55 Abs 1 to 4EStG1 General Reference is made to the wording of § 55 Abs 1 to 4 EStG on No. 10 of the decree of 10 3 1972 and the order of 11 11 1981
1317,2 starting amounts according to § 55 para 2 no
1318,"1 and 2 to 8 EStG in cases in which the actual use on July 1, 1970 deviates from the use entered in the real estate cadastre"
1319,"If the taxpayer proves that the actual use of areas on July 1, 1970 deviates from the use entered in the real estate cadastre, and if there are no yield indicators for these areas in the real estate cadastre, the starting amount must be determined in accordance with Section 55 (3) EStG"
1320,The aforementioned legal provision regulates the cases mentioned conclusively
1321,A later correction of the thus determined starting amounts after the soil appraisal has been carried out and the yield figures have been determined is not possible (see No. 10 Paragraph 9 of the Decree of 10 3 1972)
1322,VII Determination of the higher partial value according to Section 55 (5) EStG1 Application and determination The application for the determination of the higher partial value of the land on 1 7 1970 could only be submitted until 31 12 1975
1323,"In order to determine the higher partial value, reference is made to No. 11 of the decree of 10 3 1972 and the decree of 9 6 1972"

1325,2 Simplification regulation In No. 11 of the decree of 10 3 1972 it has been determined that in the case of sales or withdrawals before 1 7 1972 it can be assumed that the partial value of the land on 1 7 1970 is usually the sale price or
1326,"The withdrawal value corresponds, unless special circumstances (cf. decree of 9 6 1972) have led to a significant increase in value"
1327,Such value-increasing circumstances always exist when the sales price or
1328,the withdrawal value by more than 30%
1329,deviates upwards from the partial value on 1 7 1970
1330,"This also applies to business sales or business closures before 1 7 1972. If the simplification rule comes into play, a formal determination of the higher partial value (in the amount of the sales proceeds minus the sales costs or sales costs) can be made in sales or withdrawal cases up to 30 6 1972"

1332,But this has to be put on record
1333,"3 Effects of the determination on other types of tax The determination of a higher partial value for the land can, according to Section 69 (4) BewG (from 1 1 1974), mean that the property must be added to the real estate in the course of a subsequent determination (e.g."
1334,if arable land became building land)

1338,"VIII Loss clause The loss clause of Section 55, Paragraph 6 of the Income Tax Act is intended to prevent book losses, which arise due to the application of the flat-rate value above the partial value, from reducing profits"
1339,"According to this, losses may not be taken into account if the selling price after deducting the selling costs is less than twice the starting amount"
1340,The prohibition of deductions also applies to partial value depreciation (cf. No. 13 of the decree of 10 3 1972)
1341,"Example: Double the starting amount DM 5,000, selling price DM 3,000. The loss of DM 2,000 is not deductible under Section 55 (6) of the Income Tax Act"

1346,"2 Paragraph 55 of the EStG only applies in cases in which the land was part of the fixed assets by the end of June 30, 1970"
1347,"If land is only acquired after June 30, 1970, the land must be capitalized at the cost of acquisition"
1348,"If land is laid, the deposit is to be assessed at the partial value"
1349,Deposits are to be carried at the most at the acquisition or production costs if the inserted asset was purchased within the last three years prior to the contribution
1350,"If the land was acquired as private assets before 6/30/1970 and deposited after 6/30/1970 and within the three-year period, the deposit is double the starting amount according to Section 55 (1) to (4) EStG or the higher partial value according to Section 55 (5) EStG to be valued if these values ​​are higher than the acquisition costs"
1351,The use of these values ​​is justified because increases in land value that occurred prior to 1 7 1970 cannot be recorded by the land gain taxation
1352,"X Taxation of land gains1 In the case of profit determination according to Section 4 (3) EStG and 13a EStG (previously Section 12 GDL) with payment in installments According to Section 4 (3) sentence 4 EStG, the acquisition or production costs for non-depreciable fixed assets are only at the time of sale or Withdrawal of these assets to be considered as business expenses"
1353,"If the entire selling price does not flow in the year of the sale, but - as is the case in particular with installment payments - at a later point in time, the taxpayer has the right to choose whether to consider the acquisition costs at the time of the sale of the property as a business expense (Section 4 Para 3 sentence 4 EStG) and record the sales proceeds at the inflow (Section 11 (1) sentence 1 EStG) or whether he wants to tax the sales gain only at the point in time at which the sales proceeds exceed the acquisition costs"
1354,The right to choose applies both to the determination of profits according to Section 4 (3) EStG and to the determination of a profit surcharge according to Section 13a (8) EStG (previously Section 12 (4) No. belonged to the fixed assets and was valued at double the starting amount or the higher partial value

1375,"This new regulation applies from 1 1 1979 to 31 12 1985 (Paragraph 4) reintroduction (in modified form) of the extended tax exemption amounting to DM 60,000 for profits from the sale (new: or withdrawal) of parts of the agricultural and forestry sector Land belonging to the business (expired at the end of 1976) with effect from the 1980 calendar year"
1376,The temporal scope of the new regulation of the extended allowance does not seamlessly follow on from the previous regulation
1377,"There is a vacuum for sales after December 31, 1976 and before November 1, 1980, so that the extended tax exemption cannot be considered for sales during this period"
1378,"Changes compared to the previous regulation: in future, the removal of land will also be favored if it is transferred by way of anticipated succession or to compensate for heirs who are giving way; the period of use has been extended from 6 to 12 months; the use of the sale price for repayment of debts that belong to the agricultural forestry operation and are not in connection with the sale is no longer a favored purpose (Paragraph 5)"

1787,"in consultation with the agricultural auditors who carried out the surveys in the individual municipalities - determine the corresponding flat rate for each individual municipality belonging to the building cost group, which within the framework rate best does justice to the building costs of this municipality"
1788,"In order to avoid inconveniences, it seems advisable that, because of the determination of the lump sums for neighboring wine-growing communities with not significantly different cost structures in different tax office districts, these neighboring tax offices coordinate with each other in good time"
1789,"If the building costs for the individual municipalities have been adjusted and determined in this way, I ask that professional representatives as official experts (about 2 to 3 representatives) to hear about the intended determinations without incurring costs for the financial administration"
1790,"If the representatives of the viticulture do not give their consent, although according to the operational structure and the actual circumstances, in particular according to the established development costs, a higher than the planned flat rate is not justified for the wine-growing community in question, the tax office has the construction costs flat rate for to fix this church itself"

1804,"However, the useful life of the vines ends as soon as the vines have been cut"
1805,A depreciation is therefore no longer permitted from this point on
1806,"The lump sum is also out of the question for the fallow field, because after cutting these areas there are no more vines whose productivity (useful life) is reduced"
1807,"The occurrence of phylloxera in the contaminated wine-growing communities (Annex 2 + 3), regardless of whether they are heavily or weakly contaminated, is taken into account by a uniform extraordinary depreciation"
1808,The lump sum for this increased depreciation is - as before - 300 DM per hectare
1809,"a) First detection of phylloxera contamination (initial contamination) Based on the underlying remaining useful life of 12 years, the increased depreciation for the affected vineyards can only be considered for 12 financial years from the year of official recognition as a phylloxera-contaminated municipality"

1814,"If the twelve-year period has already expired since the first contamination (see letter a), a further increased AfA can be claimed for the vineyards of the plots immediately re-contaminated with phylloxera for a period of no more than 12 years since the re-establishment of phylloxera contamination, provided the following conditions are met: 1 The taxpayers submit the notification of the phylloxera commissioner, which shows when and immediately in which parcels again phylloxera contamination was found"
1815,2 The taxpayers provide suitable documents to prove that measures against renewed phylloxera contamination have resulted in additional expenses

1817,"If, in these cases, the 1975/76 financial year lies in the twelve-year period of both the first contamination and the renewed contamination, only the conditions required under letter a are required for the application of the lump sum for the increased depreciation"
1818,"In addition, it should be noted that in the overview of the phylloxera-infested wine-growing communities (Annex 2), the municipality of Enkirch / Bernkastel tax office was deleted because there was no initial contamination there in 1972 but re-established phylloxera contamination in the years 1972 to 1975"

1845,Such deviations can only be taken into account when the unit value is updated

2064,The Federal Fiscal Court decided this in 1970 in a model trial
2065,"The strike support is then seen as compensation for lost wages and therefore belongs, like this, to the so-called income from employment; In the opinion of the tax authorities, strike support is not taxed at the reduced tax rate provided for ""extraordinary income"" (Section 34 (2) Income Tax Act)"
2066,"Naturally, the employer cannot withhold wage tax from the strike support"
2067,They must therefore be reported to the tax office and taxed when assessing income tax
2068,"However, taxation by way of an income tax assessment does not actually take place in all cases"

2070,from strike support and interest from capital assets) up to certain income limits are not taken into account if this income does not exceed DM 800 in a calendar year

2072,"This DM 800 special regulation does not apply to persons who are taxed as single persons if their income (here: gross income minus all business expenses, special expenses and extraordinary burdens) exceeds DM 24,000"

2074,"It is the same if an assessment for income tax is requested for a special reason, for example to obtain a tax reduction from the ""§ 7b depreciation"" for the single-family house or the condominium"

2087,"According to this, the prohibition of cumulation states that this tax advantage excludes the extra-tax incentive, but not the other way around the extra-tax incentive excludes the tax relief"
2088,"The tax concessions are to be granted if the conditions specified in the Tax Act are met, even if it is certain that non-tax subsidies have been granted under the ModEnG"
2089,The grant granted is then possibly
2090,to repay
2091,"The decision as to whether there is an accumulation case is therefore made solely by the licensing authority, i"
2092,"to be met by the municipality, not by the tax office"
2093,"However, this must provide the licensing authority with the necessary factual information so that the licensing authority can make its decision"
2094,"II For this purpose, proceed as follows: 1 The licensing authorities send the tax offices that are responsible for the assessment of the respective applicant a copy of the approval notice (decree of 20 7 1978 S-2198 - 3 - V B 2)"
2095,"The tax number of the applicant results from this copy of the approval notification, provided that this has already been recorded for tax purposes, since the tax number must be specified in the application"
2096,"In the application form, the applicant also declares his consent to the tax office informing the granting authority about the use of a tax advantage"
2097,"In the approval notification (model Mod 2) under D (conditions and information) at No. 2 it is expressly stated: ""You have agreed that the tax office may inform the licensing authority about any use of a tax break within the meaning of Section 5 (3) sentence 2 ModEnG or an investment grant"
2098,"""Insofar as the applicants are already listed for tax purposes, the copies of the approval notices must be included in the tax files"
2099,"Otherwise, they are to be stored in the tax office in a central alphabetical order"
2100,"2 If, in individual cases, an application is made for a tax break of the type mentioned in Section 5 (3) ModEnG, this must be granted, provided that the tax law requirements are met"
2101,"If, in such a case, based on the copy of the approval notification, the taxpayer has been granted a subsidy, the granting authority must be informed with reference to the file number of this authority"
2102,"The facts brought forward by the taxpayer and the tax benefit to be granted must be reported, whereby it is sufficient to make a statement as to whether the benefit falls under Section 5 (3) sentence 2 ModEnG"
2103,"The preparation of a form for the notification to the granting authority is to be refrained from for the time being, since it can be assumed that the number of relevant cases is likely to be very low in view of the clear prohibition of cumulation and the control procedure known to the beneficiary"
2104,"According to this, the tax office (sub-district) has to check in those cases in which a benefit of the above-mentioned type is claimed whether a copy of a notification of approval is available"
2105,"This will be in the V files, if any"
2106,"The first time an assessment is made, it must be checked whether a notification of approval has been filed centrally"
2107,"If the tax return is processed at the transfer point, a submission to the APSt is required anyway if deductions for wear and tear, increased deductions and special depreciation for buildings are noticeably claimed for the first time (reference to the flowchart for subject 2 part 2 page 10 ALDA Fest No. 15 06)"
2108,The APSt must therefore proceed in the same way as the subdistrict (see above)

2119,282) the following is pointed out: 211 Regarding Section 13a Paragraph 1 No. 2 EStG (initial value limit) The initial value determined in accordance with Section 13a Paragraph 4 EStG is decisive
2120,Cattle surcharges can therefore not be taken into account as long as they have not been made the subject of a value update by the valuation body in accordance with §§ 41 in conjunction with 22 para. 1 no. 1 BewG
2121,Something else only applies if the requirements of Section 13a Paragraph 4 No. 1 Sentence 4 EStG are met
2122,212 On Section 13a Paragraph 1 No. 3 EStG (animal population limit) According to Section 127 Paragraph 7 EStR and No. 22 of the introductory letter of 27 03 1981 a
2123,", is to be applied accordingly when examining the VE limits of Section 13a Paragraph 1 No. 3 EStG Section 124a EStR"
2124,The prerequisite for the elimination of the calculation of the average rate of profit is that the number of VE sustainably exceeds the limits of Section 13a (1) No. 3 EStG
2125,"For the term sustainability, reference is made to Section 135 (4) EStR"
2126,"In the case of a gradual increase in the number of animals, it therefore depends on whether the number of animals converted into VE has been above the limits of Section 13a (1) No. 3 EStG over the three preceding financial years"
2127,"If, as determined by the tax office, the number of animals has exceeded the maximum permitted limits in three consecutive financial years, the requirements of Section 13a (1) No. 3 EStG are no longer met from the beginning of the fourth financial year"
2128,"If, on the other hand, the livestock are increased in one go well beyond the maximum permissible limits - e.g."
2129,"in connection with an expansion of the stable capacities - so that the livestock limits can also be expected in the following financial years, the requirements of Section 13a (1) No. 3 EStG do not apply from the time the maximum limits are exceeded for the first time"
2130,"The maximum number of animals permitted in accordance with Section 13a Paragraph 1 No. 3 and Section 13 Paragraph 1 No. 1 EStG, converted into VE, can be found in the overview attached as Annex 1"

2132,"In detail, I would like to point out the following: 221 Basic amount When determining the basic amount according to Section 13a Paragraph 4 EStG, Section 130a Paragraph 3 EStR must be observed"
2133,"222 Value of the work performance In the case of the basic amount according to Section 13a (4) EStG, it is assumed that the business is managed exclusively with paid workers (see Section 36 (2) BewG)"
2134,The value of the work performed by the business owner and his relatives who are not employed in the company on the basis of an employment relationship to be determined in accordance with Section 13a (5) EStG must therefore be added to the basic amount (Section 13a (3) No. 2 EStG)
2135,"Section 130a, Paragraphs 4 to 6 EStR must be observed here"
2136,"In detail, the following is pointed out: When determining the value of the work performance for the physical cooperation of the business owner and the relatives who are not employed, only the work performance is to be taken into account in the result, which is based on the area recorded in the initial value according to § 13a Paragraph 4 EStG in the individual case not applicable"
2137,The paid workers are to be counted towards the appropriate number of full-time workers (VAK) according to the duration of their employment (§ 13a Abs 5 Nr 5 EStG)
2138,"This also applies to temporary workers employed on a short-term basis, as well as to workers who have been made available by contractors for certain ordering, maintenance or harvesting work"
2139,For the crediting of the paid VAK
2140,"a breakdown of the wages is necessary, as far as it relates to the uses contained in the initial value (§ 13a Abs 4 EStG) and to the uses not contained therein"
2141,"the activities of other people (relatives, third parties) in the company or no or obviously incorrect information on the part of the work attributable to special uses, the (physical) work or"
2142,"the proportion of the work performed by the business owner, the relatives employed in the business and / or the remunerated workers, if applicable"
2143,with the assistance of the responsible official agricultural expert (ALS)
2144,The table in the Felsmann comment in Section C 219 on the average labor requirement for special branches of business can also serve as a guide to determine the share that is attributable to special uses
2145,The value of the work is to be calculated for owners of a part-time business in accordance with the order of 15 12 1982 S-2230 - 52 - St 113 and Section 130 Paragraph 4 Sentence 7 EStR
2146,"For examples of calculating the value of the work, see Annex 2223 Rent collected. Reference is made to Section 13a (6) sentence 2 EStG and Section 130a (7) EStR"
2147,The rent received also includes income from ground rent
2148,Income from hunting leases is compensated by the basic amount as it relates to areas included in the initial value
2149,224 Profits according to Section 13a Paragraph 8 EStG Reference is made to Section 13a Paragraph 8 EStG and Section 130a Paragraph 8 EStR
2150,"In addition, please note the following: Profits from operations that were not taken into account when determining the initial value are, for example,"
2151,"Additional profits from the sale of breeding cattle and other particularly valuable animals (see Section 2241), profits from renting rooms to holiday guests and camping sites (ESt-Kartei NW §§ 13 13a EStG A No. 82), interest income, insofar as the capital claim is attributable to the business assets is, profits from riding schools and rental of own horses, insofar as it concerns income from agriculture and forestry, profits from secondary employment, profits from investments that belong to the agricultural and forestry business assets, profits from the keeping and care of retired animals, profits from the rearing of animals in a wage system"
2152,"Profits from the cross-company use of machines, which are achieved in the context of agriculture and forestry, are not to be recorded according to Section 13a (8) No. 3 EStG"
2153,You have already been paid for by applying the basic amount (ESt-Kartei NW §§ 13 13a EStG A Nr 103)
2154,The profits (additional profits) according to § 13a Paragraph 8 EStG are basically to be determined by comparing the operating income and operating expenses (§ 4 Paragraph 3 EStG)
2155,"If no records are available, the profits (additional profits) are to be estimated according to the principles of Section 4 Paragraph 1 EStG (Section 130a Paragraph 8 Sentences 8 - 11 EStR)"
2156,"When estimating the profits (additional profits) from sales of breeding cattle and other particularly valuable animals as well as from vegetable growing and intensive fruit growing in the context of horticultural use, the following guidelines can serve as a guide"
2157,Their application must not lead to an obviously incorrect taxation (see BFH judgment of 16 12 1965 BStBl 1966 III p
2158,193)
2159,"2241 Sales of breeding cattle and other valuable animals As additional profit from the sale of breeding cattle and other particularly valuable animals, 80 per cent"
2160,"the amount by which the individual sales proceeds including sales tax exceed the following starting values ​​(normal prices): Breeding bulls 2600 DMBreeding cows2200 DMBreeding cattle2000 DMBreeding boars and sows700 DMBreeding and riding horses3000 DMWages for paid workers, insurance and sales costs, etc."
2161,") are taken into account in the level of these initial values, so they cannot be deducted separately"
2162,The same procedure is then to be followed if above-average prices are obtained for breeding animals other than those specified or for other valuable animals
2163,The initial value to be used in these cases results from the tax production costs of the animal species in question plus an assumed profit surcharge of 20% included in the initial value for the area under normal animal husbandry
2164,"2242 Vegetable growing (horticultural use) To distinguish vegetable growing (horticultural use) from vegetable growing within the framework of agricultural use, I refer to Sections 108, Paragraph 2 and 607, Paragraph 1, No. 1 BewRL 1964.If vegetable growing is included in agricultural use, there is a surcharge according to § 13a Paragraph 8 of the Income Tax Act not applicable"
2165,"Vegetables are only grown in the context of agricultural use if headed cabbage (white, red and savoy cabbage), picking peas and picking beans are grown exclusively using agricultural cultivation methods as part of agricultural crop rotation as the main crop"
2166,"On the other hand, if the types of cabbage and / or peas or"
2167,Do not alternate beans with other agricultural crops such as

2171,It is then rather about vegetable growing (horticultural use)

2177,"The profit is influenced by the type of marketing (auction in the wholesale market, sale on the farm, sale on the weekly market) and the wage expenditure"
2178,In the case of vegetable growing without roofed growing areas or with roofed growing areas up to 3%
2179,"of the total vegetable growing area, the profit can also be estimated based on the number of unpaid family workers (FAK) fully employed in vegetable growing as follows: For a vegetable growing area - up to 2 ha 16,000 DM / FAK - from 2 to 4 ha 22,000 DM / FAK - over 4 ha38000 DM / FAK This estimation method is particularly suitable for cases in which the operating income has not been specified or has obviously been incomplete"

2181,only possible in close cooperation with the ALS

2183,"between 15,000 and 35,000 DM per hectare"

2491,Agenda item II / 1 General information on the standard valuation of business assets and wealth tax The wealth tax revenue in Hesse rose in 1979 compared to 1978 to 4972 million or 33%
2492,"This considerable amount, which represents just under 2% of the total tax revenue in Hesse, is distributed in very different ways when viewed regionally"
2493,Almost 90% of the income from wealth tax came from the Darmstadt administrative region and only a little more than 1/10 from the Kassel administrative region
2494,"This is explained on the one hand by the fact that in the Frankfurt area there are relatively few, but capital-intensive, large companies - predominantly AGs - have their headquarters and the wealth tax is to be paid to the domicile FA and not to the permanent establishment FA, on the other hand because that the wealth tax of the corporations subject to corporate income tax is levied by central tax offices"
2495,"Globally, Kassel ranks fourth among the Hessian tax offices for wealth tax revenue"
2496,In the administrative region of Kassel DM 37 wealth tax is collected per capita
2497,These few figures are certainly not particularly impressive - at least if you know the revenue figures for other types of tax
2498,Much more meaningful is therefore what is hidden behind these figures in terms of workload and performance of our employees in the tax offices
2499,"While the number of natural persons subject to wealth tax in Hesse has hardly changed significantly for years - it is around 60,000 on the individual reference dates - the number of corporations subject to wealth tax is constantly increasing"
2500,"It moved from a good 17,000 on the reference date 1 1 76 to 26,519 on the reference date 1 1 80, which is an increase of approx"
2501,9434 or 552%
2502,This rapid increase in the number of signals in the corporate sector is undoubtedly largely due to corporate and tax law considerations of taxpayers
2503,"The liability law considerations in connection with the reform of GmbH law, namely the planned increase in the share capital to DM 50,000, will certainly not lead to a reduction in growth rates in the near future"
2504,This increase in the number of corporations has already had consequences in the area of ​​personnel at the central tax offices and will also result in further increases in the number of staff in the Kö area
2505,This only as a perspective reference
2506,"The number of BV signals, on the other hand, experienced a drastic reduction in the course of the year compared to 1 1 1979"
2507,"It decreased by 50,168 from 199810 to 149,642 on the reference date 1 1 1980"
2508,This corresponds to a decrease of 25% and indicates that the OFD-Vfg is well received
2509,vom 19 3 1979 - S-3108 - 6 - St III 42 and shows the will of the legislature to relieve small and medium-sized businesses
2510,"In the future, we should therefore pay particular attention to the development of the signal numbers, especially when it comes to the uniform valuation of the business assets, and the maintenance of the basic code letters should always be in the focus of the SGL and SB"
2511,We have to come to terms with the fact that more staff is practically not available at all and should therefore always perceive reasonable and legally possible relief for the existing workforce at all levels

2527,"In the following, only the changes that are important for the uniform valuation of business assets and the assessment of wealth tax are listed: Section 3 Paragraph 1 Adjustment to the tax exemption to be reduced from commercial capital (Section 13 Paragraph 1 GewStG)"
2528,"Sections 34 (1) a, 44 (6), 48 (1) a and 55 (7) new regulation of the treatment of claims and obligations in kind based on the case law of the BFH"

2546,to be obtained if the unit value of the business assets is likely to be of importance for the determination of the commercial capital or the assessment for wealth tax
2547,"It can be assumed that this is the case if the unit value of the business assets according to the information in the balance sheet or the income-surplus account is likely to be at least 30,000 DM"
2548,It has been suggested that in many cases it is practically impossible to check and observe this limit
2549,What experiences do the other tax offices have and what should be done in the future
2550,"According to Section 3, Paragraph 1 of the VStR 1980, a unit value does not need to be determined if, for operation with commercial capital i"
2551,"of § 12 GewStG on January 1, 1980 of less than DM 60,000, from January 1, 1981 onwards of less than DM 120,000 (allowance according to § 13 Paragraph 1 GewStG) and the unit value is also not required for wealth tax"
2552,"According to the experience of the tax offices, in many cases it can only be decided after the statement of assets has been submitted whether this is the case"
2553,"The GKB ""BV"" should therefore only not be set or"
2554,invalid if the unit value of the business assets is obviously not relevant for the determination of the commercial capital or the assessment for wealth tax
2555,A fixed limit should not be set as it does not take into account the different circumstances that exist among commercial establishments
2556,"For the complete recording of all taxpayers who are to be assessed for wealth tax (wealth taxpayers), I had in the Rdvfg"
2557,from 11 Sept.
2558,"1979 - S-3543 A - 1 - St III 42 VSt-Kartei Allgemeines Karte 7 asked all taxpayers who declare income from capital assets of more than 15,000 DM and / and a total amount of income of more than 250,000 DM to submit a wealth tax return to the 1 1 1980 (main assessment date) to be sent"
2559,The HMdF has instructed the HZD to issue test note no.546 in these cases
2560,What experiences could be gained in connection with the recording of property taxpayers?
2561,The tax offices had not yet had any experience of the effects of the two borders
2562,"However, individual tax offices have pointed out that the case of notification is usually printed out in the case of taxpayers already assessed for wealth tax and the processing thus causes avoidable extra work"
2563,"The suggestion to only print out the reference case if no GKB ""VN"" has been set for the checklist cannot be implemented due to programming difficulties"
2564,The exchange of experience showed that in many cases those who handled the cases should know whether the taxpayer has already been assessed for wealth tax and therefore there is no need to pull the tax files
2565,can also be noted when creating the income tax entry form that the tax has been assessed for wealth tax or
2566,is assessed
2567,"In order to achieve the most complete possible recording of all taxpayers that are to be assessed for wealth tax, a list of the tax numbers for which the test note no. 546 was printed out should be sent to the tax offices in the spring of 1981"
2568,The tax offices will then use this list to check which tax returns are still to be sent on 1 1 1980
2569,"b) Workflow The statements of assets and wealth tax returns for January 1, 1980 should, if possible, be processed together with the tax returns for the 1979 calendar year"
2570,"A time-saving and rational evaluation of tax returns and balance sheet documents can only be achieved through joint processing; because in the statement of assets on 1 1 1980, the values ​​of the property and debt items according to the BewG are to be compared with the values ​​of the tax balance sheet as of December 31, 1979 and the information in the wealth tax return must be compared to those in the income tax return of the previous year due to the interaction of assets and income or"

2575,"joint processing is more rational not only for financial management, but also for members of the tax advisory professions"
2576,"If the unit value of the business assets and the wealth tax are determined in the same calculation, the unit value of the business assets can be automatically taken into account in the wealth tax assessment if ""1"" is entered in code 273"
2577,"Since the tax debts and tax refund claims resulting from the income tax assessment 1979 are required for the wealth tax assessment on 1 1 1980, these two items are to be left open in the entry form"
2578,The input forms are to be collected in a folder and then processed after the income tax assessments are available
2579,It has not proven expedient to postpone the processing of wealth tax returns
2580,"In the case of the ""wealth tax campaign"" which is then required, usually only the declared information is adopted and the interactions between the wealth and income tax return and the necessary new assessments are not taken into account"
2581,Only if the proposed way of working is practiced in the tax offices will the SB and 1 employee lose their fear of wealth tax assessments and an improvement in the quality of work can be achieved
2582,Shares in companies or communities must often be taken into account when determining the unit value of business assets and property tax assessments

2642,"Objects whose preservation is in the public interest, Section 115 BewG)"
2643,43 Debts of the community towards a participant are to be included in the separate determination (Section 93 a Paragraph 2 No. 3 VStR)
2644,The division must be carried out regardless of the person involved
2645,"From an economic point of view, however, a taxpayer cannot have any claims / debts against himself"
2646,"For this reason, a claim against the community is only reduced in the wealth tax assessment of the participant in order to include the share of the debt attributable to him from the community"
2647,The tax office responsible for the separate determination must therefore specifically identify the share of the community's debt attributable to the parties involved by means of a corresponding note in the notification of the determination and in the notification for the tax office of the residence
2648,The local tax office then has to deduct this particular debt in the corresponding overall claim against the community
2649,"In this way, the amount of the debt is taken over as a basic determination, but in the case of the property tax of the participant it is converted into a reduction portion of the claim, because according to Section 93 a Paragraph 3 VStR, the wealth tax assessment of the participant only depends on his personal circumstances (HMdF decree of 13 11 1978 - S-3600 A-32-II B 43)"

2707,c) Determination of the partial value of movable fixed assets (Section 52 VStR) aa) General The partial value is expressly prescribed for assets of movable fixed assets
2708,"If these assets are shown in the tax balance sheet with the partial value, this can usually be taken over as valuation"
2709,Often the value shown in the tax balance sheet does not correspond to the partial value
2710,The valuations shown by a taxpayer in his statement of assets for the purpose of the uniform valuation of commercial business assets therefore generally need to be checked
2711,The principles of the partial value determination are contained in Sect. 52 Paragraphs 2 and 3 VStR: Upper limit - replacement costs Lower limit - material or scrap value
2712,"For fully used assets, usually the replacement costs"
2713,The individual selling price for assets that are only used temporarily
2714,"The replacement costs include the costs that would have to be applied in the case of replacement, taking into account the actual condition of the asset on the valuation date"
2715,"To determine the replacement costs, the required acquisition or production costs on the valuation date are the starting point"
2716,The normal wear and tear can be deducted from this
2717,"In addition to the linear deduction method, a lower deduction can also be taken into account (see Section 52 Paragraph 1 VStR - z"
2718,"the degressive depreciation, but no special depreciation)"
2719,"bb) Assets that were acquired or manufactured no more than 3 years ago before the valuation date Here, price changes are not taken into account when determining the replacement costs"
2720,"A partial value depreciation, which is exceptionally permitted for income tax purposes, is to be adopted in terms of valuation"

2724,"When calculating a surcharge or a discount, the price development of the respective group of goods or industrial goods, the time between acquisition or manufacture of the asset on the valuation date and technical or economic obsolescence must be taken into account"

2736,ee) Review of the valuations by the tax office Experience has shown that the review of the values ​​for the assets of the movable fixed assets shown in the statement of assets repeatedly causes difficulties

2738,the advisors of the taxpayers only the values ​​according to
2739,"Income tax balance sheet or insignificantly higher values, which often go to a full DM 100 or"
2740,1000 DM will be rounded up
2741,"In such cases, a complaint about the valuation is appropriate"
2742,This complaint has to be made by asking the taxpayer or
2743,to his advisor
2744,It is not possible to wait until this company is checked by the company audit
2745,This only appears appropriate if the implementation of the tax audit is foreseeable and therefore the standard valuation notification is issued subject to the review (Section 164 AO)
2746,"Experience with departmental audits has shown that when such values ​​are recognized as part of the standard value determination, these values ​​are often also taken over as partial values ​​by the company audit"
2747,In the Rdvfg
2748,"from April 2, 1980 - S-3644 A - 7 - St III 42 is u"
2749,"You have been advised to check the partial values ​​of the movable assets in compliance with the instructions in Sections 51 and 52 VStR and, if necessary, to"
2750,to complain

2753,The form issued under camp number 484 c will also serve to inform taxpayers or taxpayers
2754,"to arrange for their advisors to provide information about the determination of the partial values ​​specified in the statement of assets, if necessary"
2755,"ff) Valuation of the low-value fixed assets (Section 52 Paragraph 4 VStR) In general, the assets acquired or manufactured in the last 5 years can be summarized with their acquisition or production costs"
2756,"Of this, the partial value can be 40%"
2757,be accepted
2758,It is assumed that the annual acquisition costs are roughly the same
2759,Examples for special cases: A) 1 year = 10000 DM 100% depreciation = 10000 DM valuation = 0 DM2 year = 0 DM-3 year = 0 DM-4 year = 1000 DM 40% depreciation = 400 DM valuation = 600 DM5 year = 2000 DM 20% depreciation = 400 DM valuation = 1600 DM total
2760,": 13000 DM 10800 DM2200 DM40% of 13000 DM acquisition costs are 5200 DM In such a case, the application of the partial value of 2200 DM can be granted"
2761,B) The company was founded about 2 years ago
2762,"1 - 3 year without calculation 4 year (year of foundation) 5000 DM 40% depreciation = 2000 DM Value approach = 3000 DM5 year 3000 DM 20% depreciation = 600 DM ""2400 DM total: 8000 DM 2600 DM 5400 DM In this case, the partial value can be determined with 40%"
2763,the acquisition costs are not recognized
2764,It is therefore not 40 BC
2765,"the acquisition cost = 3200 DM, but 5400 DM as the partial value"
2766,The review of the determination of the partial value of the low-value assets of the movable fixed assets prepares on the basis of the acquisition costs or
2767,Production costs of such assets are usually not a problem
2768,"Should the valuation shown in the statement of assets for these assets appear questionable, a review of the balance sheet documents is definitely advisable"
2769,"gg) For tools, equipment and other aids, according to Section 51 Paragraph 3 VStR, an assessment based on average rates per head of workers engaged in similar work is possible"
2770,"As a rule, these are items for which a fixed value is established in the tax balance sheet"
2771,Agenda item III / 3 Determination of the partial value for product stocks (section 52 a VStR) The partial value for product stocks (work in progress and finished goods manufactured in-house) corresponds to their restoration costs (section 52 (1) sentence 1 VStR)
2772,"According to section 52 a, paragraph 1, sentence 3 (of the draft of) VStER 1980, when determining the partial value of the product inventories, in addition to the manufacturing costs set according to section 33 of the 1978 income tax, the sales costs incurred up to the reference date (incl"
2773,the costs for transport to a distribution warehouse and for packaging)
2774,"The term ""administrative costs incurred in the production area"" used in the previous guidelines was contradictory and unusual; because costs incurred in the production area are either production costs or production overheads"
2775,"It has now been made clear that when determining the partial value, the administrative costs are only included to the extent that they are already included in the value determined in accordance with Section 33 of the EStR"
2776,The additional administrative costs incurred are not taken into account
2777,"The price increases that occurred up to the reference date are not to be taken into account (HMdF decree of June 28, 1978 - S-3231 A - 45 - II B 43)"
2778,"The sales costs incurred up to the reference date are to be taken into account when determining the partial value of the products, since they would also have to be paid by an purchaser of the entire company within the framework of the total purchase price"
2779,"According to Section 52 a Paragraph 2 VStR, the partial value for product stocks can also be determined in such a way that the values ​​shown in the tax balance sheet are increased by percentage surcharges that take into account the conditions of the company"
2780,"The Dillenburg tax office has reported that on the basis of experience gained in the course of company audits, a surcharge of 5% in cases where the corresponding calculation documents are not available in the company"
2781,is made
2782,What experiences do you have with other tax offices?
2783,"According to the experience of the tax authorities, the following procedure should be used: Since the sales costs incurred up to the reporting date must be taken into account when determining the partial value of the product inventories in addition to the manufacturing costs stated in accordance with Section 33 EStR, the values ​​in the tax balance sheet cannot be included in the statement of assets"
2784,"Unless there are indications of a higher or lower surcharge (number and distance of the distribution warehouse, type of packaging) in individual cases, the values ​​shown in the tax balance should be increased by 5%"
2785,increase
2786,"Agenda item III / 4 Wealth tax treatment of usufructuary rights to shares in a partnership Shares in a corporation (in particular in a GmbH) a securities account General objects of usufruct (§ 1030 BGB) can be a property, a movable property, a right (§ 1068 BGB) or even the assets of a person to be (§ 1085 BGB)"
2787,"The order of the usufruct conveys the inalienable and inalienable (in principle non-transferable) real (it encumbrances the usufructuary object as such) to draw the usufructs from the encumbered object, as far as the usufruct is not limited by the exclusion of individual usages (§ 1030 Abs 2 BGB)"
2788,"However, unless otherwise specified, the usufructuary can leave the exercise of the right to someone else (§ 1059 BGB)"
2789,Usufruct arises as a rule through a legal transaction on movable objects through agreement and transfer (§ 1032 BGB) on real estate through agreement and entry in the land register (§ 873 BGB) to rights according to the regulations applicable to their transfer (§ 1069 paragraph 1 BGB)
2790,"The usufruct ends when the agreed deadline expires, the legal person is dissolved, or the person entitled is given up or dies (§§ 875 1061 1062 1064 BGB)"
2791,Usufruct and rights of use are assets that can be valued and are therefore also subject to wealth tax
2792,"Insofar as they do not belong to another type of asset (business assets), they are to be taken into account with the capital value of other assets in accordance with Section 110 (1) No. 4 BewG"
2793,"According to Sections 13 and 14 BewG, the capital value of a usufruct is calculated by multiplying the annual value"
2794,The annual value is the amount resulting from the uses after deduction of the expenses to be borne by the user in connection with the burdened asset
2795,"When determining the annual value, it should be noted that uses and services that are not in money are to be assessed at the usual mean prices of the place of consumption (Section 15 (2) BewG)"
2796,"In the case of uses and services that are uncertain or fluctuate in their amount, the annual value is to be taken as the basis that will probably be achieved in the future on average over the years (Section 15 (3) BewG, Section 61 (2) VStR)"
2797,"According to § 16 BewG, when determining the capital value of the uses of an asset, the annual value of these uses cannot be more than the eighteenth part of the value that results from the provisions of the Valuation Act for the asset used"
2798,"In addition, all claims to pensions or other uses and services are recorded for property tax purposes that they do not belong to other assets insofar as the annual value of the uses and services does not exceed DM 4800 in total if the person entitled is over 60 years old or is likely to be for at least 3 Years of incapacity for work (Section 111 No. 9 BewG)"
2799,To a) Usufruct in shares in a partnership Since shareholders in a partnership cannot transfer the claims to which they are entitled to one another from the corporate relationship (Section 717 BGB i
2800,"V with § 1069 Paragraph 2 BGB) and a partner of a partnership in general cannot dispose of his share of the company assets and the individual associated objects (joint ownership, § 719 BGB), a usufruct of the company assets is fundamentally inadmissible"
2801,"However, the transfer of membership rights can be permitted in the articles of association or even the establishment of a usufruct can be expressly permitted (Section 105 (2) i"
2802,"V with § 109 HGB for OHG, § 161 Abs 2 HGB for KG)"
2803,"If one of these requirements is met and a usufruct is legally effective for this share in the company and the usufructuary actually exercises all rights, such as"
2804,"the administrative and usufructuary rights, voting rights and all obligations of the shareholder (e.g."
2805,"Contribution obligation), the usufructuary takes the place of the previous shareholder, but without becoming the beneficial owner"
2806,The establishment of the usufruct is then generally recognized for tax purposes
2807,"In these cases, the usufructuary is to be regarded as a co-entrepreneur for income tax purposes and he receives income from commercial operations (BFH of 11 4 1973 BStBl II p"
2808,528)
2809,"In terms of valuation law and property tax, the usufruct of the company share is to be recorded in accordance with Section 110 (1) No. 4 BewG for other assets, unless it belongs to another type of asset (business assets)"
2810,The evaluation of the usufruct is based on §§ 13 to 16 BewG
2811,"When determining the net present value, the annual value of the actual uses must be assumed"
2812,"On the question of which uses a usufructuary is entitled to in a company share in a partnership, the BGH has ruled in the judgment of 20 4 1972 - II ZR 143/69 - BB 1972 p"

2814,"According to this, the usufructuary of a social participation subject to usufruct does not owe the profits of the company per se, but only those profit shares which the partner himself is entitled to withdraw within the framework of the law, the articles of association and the annual financial statements"
2815,The usufructuary income as intended (§§ 1030 100 99 Paragraph 2 BGB) is only to be understood as the share of the company's assets declared by the shareholders after the formation of any reserves as a surplus and thus released for distribution
2816,The BFH also goes in the judgment of 4 6 1980 - BStBl II p
2817,608 - on the assumption that the extractable profit share is to be taken as the basis for the annual value of a right to use a company share
2818,"The profit share that can be withdrawn does not only mean the profit share that is paid out, but also the share that is credited to clearing or loan accounts"
2819,"However, the parts of the profit share that the previous shareholder is entitled to due to personal performance (e.g."
2820,because of an activity for the company)

2822,"7 b to § 15 BewG mean that free reserves allotted to the company share, z"
2823,"for expansion investments, added to the annual value of the usufructuary"
2824,"As the profit shares that can be withdrawn fluctuate regularly, the annual value is based on the amount that is expected to be achieved in the future on average over the years (Section 15 (3) BewG)"
2825,Neither Section 15 (3) BewG nor Section 61 (2) VStR say anything about the number of years to be used as a basis for estimating the average amount

2830,"Rössler-Troll-Langner, commentary on the BewG and VStG, note"

2832,These views must be followed with the restriction that circumstances that occurred after the reference date but which were already foreseeable on the reference date must be taken into account (BFH of 13 1 1956 BStBl III p
2833,62 and from 9 9 1960 BStBl 1961 III p
2834,Losses can only be taken into account when determining the annual value if the usufructuary is used for this as agreed (e.g.

2836,"According to § 16 BewG, when determining the capital value of the uses of an asset, the annual value of these uses must not be more than the eighteenth part of the value that results from the provisions of the Valuation Act for the asset used"
2837,"In the case of a usufruct of a company share of a partnership, the annual value of the usufruct must therefore not exceed the eighteenth part of the share of the unit value of the business assets"
2838,The same applies if only a mandatory (contractual) right to use a company share has been agreed (cf. BFH of 4 6 1980 a
2839,) and there is a close legal and economic connection between the profit entitlements and the asset used (company share)
2840,"From the usufruct of the company share of a partnership, civil law must distinguish the usufruct of the claims to disbursement flowing from the company share aa) the profit shares (during the existence of the company), bb) the compensation credit (when the partner leaves), cc) the dispute credit (in the event of dissolution of the company) and the usufruct of the profit master rights (cf."
2841,"These property rights are easily transferable (assignable, pledgeable and attachable) and can be charged with usufruct (§§ 717 sentence 2 1069 paragraph 2 BGB)"
2842,"Siebert (usufruct in the profit right of the partner in a general partnership, BB 1956 p"

2844,"208) takes the view that an usufruct order for individual - already due or future - profit claims would result in the usufructuary not acquiring the claim on the profit and the amounts paid accordingly on these claims, but the profit claims themselves being the object of usufruct and therefore only the uses resulting from the individual profit claim (e.g."
2845,Interest) are fruits of usufruct
2846,He therefore sees in the appointment of a usufruct in the profit master rights the only possibility to have a non-shareholder (third party) as usufructuary only participate in the company profitably without having to appoint a usufruct of the entire company share
2847,"Also Herrmann-Heuer, commentary on the EStG and KStG, note"
2848,"27 h (2) to § 15 EStG, only differentiate between a usufruct of the participation (or the capital share) and the usufruct of the profit claim, the claim to the dispute assets (and probably also compensation credits), in which the beneficiary has the uses in the form of interest and the like"

2850,"the credit) but is not allowed to keep it himself, unless it has been given to him and the net profit usufruct or the usufruct of the profit master right"
2851,"In contrast, the BFH holds it in the judgment of 7 2 1973 BStBl II p"
2852,493 it is still possible to order a usufruct of the so-called profit participation right with the result that the entitled person can claim the profit claims resulting from the company share
2853,Also in the judgment of 28 11 1974 BStBl 1975 II p
2854,"498 500, the BFH still assumes that a shareholder's ""profit participation right"" could be the subject of usufruct"
2855,"By this he obviously understands a ""usufruct in the claim of a partner to his share of the profit, which as usufruct of a right (§ 1068 BGB) represents a real encumbrance of this right"""
2856,"As stated above, a usufruct of the claim to the profit share would, however, mean that the beneficiaries only receive interest and the like"
2857,to be entitled
2858,"It is therefore doubtful which uses a usufructuary of the profit claim of a company share, which may"
2859,is referred to as profit participation rights

2863,"On the other hand, whether there is a ""profit master right"" to be separated from the membership in a partnership, which can be independently encumbered with a usufruct as a right in rem, is controversial under civil law"
2864,"To this end, the BGH ruled in the judgment of 12 December 1974 - II ZR 166/722 - BB 1975 p"
2865,"295 - stated that it could be left open whether there is a profit master right to be separated from the membership, which could be independently encumbered with a usufruct"
2866,"If one recognizes such a possibility, then in any case it does not give the usufructuary co-administration powers over and above the profit reference, which a shareholder is entitled to as exclusion of his membership"
2867,In its judgment of 13.5.1976 BStBl II S
2868,"592, with reference to the above-mentioned BGH ruling, take the view that there is no profit master right to be separated from membership, which can be independently encumbered with a usufruct"
2869,"However, the Senate did not need to take a final position"
2870,"Likewise, he could leave open which legal effects under civil law should be attributed to a usufruct of the profit master rights, in particular whether (as in the case of a usufruct of the individual profit claims) the usufructuary only uses the profit claims or"
2871,the amounts of money paid for their fulfillment (e.g.
2872,the interest on these profit entitlements or amounts of money) or (as in the case of an assignment) these profit entitlements themselves (
2873,) were due and finally remained
2874,"Taking into account the reasons given, the BFH came to the decision that the usufruct in the profit master rights of a share in a partnership - assuming that this is at all legally justifiable under civil law - corresponds to its civil law and economic content after an advance assignment of future profit claims so largely that this usufruct In terms of income tax law, how an advance assignment is to be assessed"
2875,"When ordering a usufruct on the profit master rights, the source of income remains with the usufruct buyer, just as it would continue to be in the hands of the assignee even if future profit claims were assigned"
2876,"Until the questions raised have been clarified, the following applies for wealth tax purposes: As stated above, the usufruct of the company share of a partnership is to be recorded for wealth tax purposes"
2877,"The determination of the net present value of the usufructuary right is based on the annual value, which results in consideration of the limitation of § 16 BewG (eighteenth part of the respective share of the unit value of the business assets)"
2878,"Even if a right of use to a company share should only be of a contractual nature, the limitation of § 16 BewG on the annual value must be observed if there is a close legal and economic connection between the uses and the economic good used (see BFH rulings of 24 4 1970 BStBl II p"

2883,"the interest on these profit entitlements or the monetary amounts), the annual value is the sum of the interest or"
2884,"based on the amounts of money paid for their fulfillment, taking into account Section 15 (3) BewG"
2885,"When limiting the annual value of the uses according to § 16 BewG, however, the capital value of the entitlement to the profit share (calculated according to the above"
2886,"Statements on the usufruct of the company share), since the claim to the profit share is a right that can be separated from membership"
2887,The annual value of the uses must therefore not be more than the eighteenth part of the capital value of the entitlement to profit share
2888,"If it is only a matter of a contractual use of the claim to the profit share, the corresponding explanations for 1 are to be applied accordingly"
2889,"However, a close legal and economic connection should only exist if z"
2890,"the profit shares are invested in a joint account or if he has been given the opportunity to influence the investment of the profit shares and thus the amount of the use (interest), but the usufructuary is only entitled to dispose of the interest"
2891,"If a usufruct would be granted to the settlement credit or the liquidation credit, the beneficiary will only enjoy the benefits when the shareholder resigns or"
2892,the company has been dissolved
2893,The claims are conditional (§ 4 BewG) and can only be considered if the condition has been met
2894,"If the condition is met, the remarks on 2 apply accordingly to the property tax treatment of the usage claims"
2895,Since - as stated above - the admissibility of a usufruct in a profit master right is at least controversial or at least under civil law
2896,"in the opinion of the BFH is to be answered in the negative, such a claim is not to be recorded as a usufruct for property tax purposes"
2897,"If it can be assumed at all that a purely contractual claim to the profit shares represents a use of the profit master rights, the limitation of the annual value according to § 16 BewG would not come into play because a close legal and economic connection taking into account the statements in the BFH judgment from 13 5 1976 a"
2898,must be denied
2899,The claims from a so-called usufruct of the profit master rights are therefore to be assessed like recurring services
2900,"If a usufruct of the so-called profit participation right has been agreed between the parties, in which the usufructuary can claim the profit shares as ""uses"", according to the above"
2901,It is assumed that this is a matter of claims from the profit master right or similar claims (see also the BFH judgment of 4 6 1980 a

2906,"In addition, it should be noted that - as long as the civil law requirements are met (e.g."
2907,Consent of the shareholders) - the respective claims can be limited to certain quota of claims through corresponding agreements
2908,Both the (real) usufructuary obligation and the legal obligation to allow a third party to use an asset are encumbrances that can be deducted from the raw assets in accordance with Section 118 (1) No. 1 BewG
2909,"If the limitation of Section 16 BewG was applicable, it applies to both the authorized user and the party obliged to use it (see BFH judgment of 20 1 1978 a"
2910,"If a usufruct or other right of use or a usufruct or other obligation to use belongs to a business asset, the valuation is carried out - as described above - both as a property item and as a debt item with the items according to §§ 13 ff BewG in connection with section 61 bis 63 VStR resulting capital values ​​(Section 42 Paragraph 2 VStR)"
2911,"b) Usufruct in shares of a corporation (especially in a GmbH) While the usufructuary of a share package is only entitled to the distributed dividends that represent the annual value, in the case of a usufruct in a GmbH share, the dividend of the share in the Year of acquisition was distributed as an average amount; rather, the average yield that is likely to be achievable in the future must also be estimated here"
2912,"Here, too, Section 78 Paragraph 1 of the VStR should apply mutatis mutandis, so that the annual value can be derived from the average income from the last three years before the key date for determining the net present value"
2913,The limitation of the annual value according to § 16 BewG is based on the stock exchange price for securities encumbered by usufruct and debt register claims that are admitted to official trading on a German stock exchange on the reference date (§ 11 Para
2914,"V with § 113 BewG) and for shares in corporations that do not fall under § 11 Paragraph 1 BewG, according to the fair value (§ 11 Paragraph 2 BewG)"
2915,"c) Usufruct in a securities account To determine the annual value of the usufruct in a securities account, the above apply"
2916,Principles accordingly
2917,"If the securities account also contains papers with fluctuating income, the annual value must be derived from the average amount in accordance with Section 15 (3) BewG"
2918,The limitation of § 16 BewG is to be determined proportionately according to the respective value resulting from the provisions of the Valuation Act for the securities contained in the securities account
2919,Agenda item III / 5 Assessment of usufructuary rights and mandatory profit participation rights in commercial operations and in company shares Regarding the facts: The appointment of a usufruct gives the inalienable and inalienable (in principle non-transferable) right in rem to derive the uses from the encumbered object
2920,The will therefore only results in the obligation for the heirs to grant the beneficiaries the usufruct
2921,This obligation of the heirs on the basis of the will does not constitute an effective civil usufruct
2922,"However, if the prerequisites for a legally permissible appointment of the usufruct of the company share exist (agreement in the articles of association on the transferability of membership rights or the appointment of a usufruct and agreement on the usufruct between the parties), the capital value of the usufruct in accordance with § 110 para 1 No. 4 BewG on other assets"
2923,The capital value results from the application of the duplicator to be taken from Annex 9 of the VStR to the annual value
2924,"According to Section 15 (3) BewG, the annual value is the amount that is expected to be achieved in the future on average over the years, applying Section 78 (1) VStR accordingly"
2925,"However, the annual value of the usufruct must not be more than the eighteenth part of the value that results from the provisions of the Valuation Act for the asset used (Section 16 BewG)"
2926,"Since the right of use is limited to only part of the total use, because the beneficiary is only allowed to dispose of a limited share of the profit share that is attributable to the burdened company shares, the maximum amount of the annual value is reduced according to"
2927,Section 63 sentence 6 VStR accordingly (example: the uses are limited to 50 percent
2928,of the respective profit share
2929,According to
2930,The annual value resulting from Section 15 (3) BewG must not exceed 50%
2931,the relevant proportion of the unit value of the business assets)

2933,The agreement to give the previous entrepreneur an obligatory profit drawing right in the amount of a certain v
2934,Granting a rate of profit does not constitute a grant of a right of use
2935,The entitlements in the amount of part of the annual profits are therefore treated as recurring benefits for wealth tax purposes
2936,Section 16 BewG therefore does not apply
2937,"Agenda item III / 6 Wealth tax treatment of no longer appropriate profit shares in family, partnerships and dormant partnershipsa) Question of the approach of an excessive profit sharing"
2938,"In the case of the establishment of a family company by taking in the children of the previous individual business owner, this enables them as a gift recipient to generate additional new assets at the expense of the giver's profit share, is to be regarded as an independent gift, which is to be assessed at the capital value (cf. § 7 Paragraph 6 ErbStG)"
2939,This is intended to ensure that this pecuniary advantage is recorded in a tax-appropriate manner
2940,"An excess of profit participation exists if the capital participation is equipped with a profit participation which in particular does not correspond to the capital contribution, the work or other performance of the partner for the company or which would not normally be granted to a third party"
2941,"In these cases, the taxable average return should not exceed 15%"
2942,the actual value of the participation (see also Section 138 (2) sentence 6 EStR)
2943,Excessive profit sharing can be given in particular when underage children participate in partnerships (family companies)
2944,Example: It is to be assumed that there is an agreement that is valid under civil law
2945,"Participation (donated by the father) - EW share = 100,000 DM annual average yield = 30,000 DM of which are recognized for income tax purposes = 15,000 DM remaining = 15,000 DM According to § 13 Paragraph 2 2 Half-Sentence BewG, a capitalization of this amount with 9 times should be considered"
2946,"According to the inheritance tax regulation in the identical decrees of the highest tax authorities of the federal states of December 20, 1974 in the version of March 10, 1976 (BStBl I S"
2947,"145 ff) for the calculation of the capital value, unless there are other indications for the term, it is to be assumed that the excessive profit share will accrue to the considered for a period of 5 years in the same amount"
2948,"In the present case this would mean that using Table 2 in Appendix 2a VStR 1977 the net present value for DM 1 would be DM 427, so that the total net present value would be DM 64050 (15000 x 427)"
2949,This concerns other assets of the child i
2950,of § 110 Paragraph 1 No. 4 BewG
2951,"For the determination in individual cases, however, it will essentially depend on the tax treatment of the giver of such a participation"
2952,"If a deduction is recognized in accordance with Section 103 (1) BewG or in accordance with Section 118 (1) No. 1 BewG, the beneficiary must also recognize it as other assets"
2953,"In case of doubt, we ask you to report on your experiences"
2954,b) Wealth tax treatment of silent partnerships The silent partner's contribution is to be treated as a capital claim
2955,"If the contribution is part of the business assets, a valuation according to § 109 Abs 4 BewG comes into consideration (valuation according to the principles of the taxable profit determination)"
2956,"If the silent partner's contribution is part of his / her other assets, the valuation must be carried out in accordance with Section 56 (7) VStR"
2957,"The obligation of the entrepreneur due to a typical silent partnership, on the other hand, must always be valued at the nominal value of the silent partner's contribution (see section 30 VStR)"
2958,"Agenda item III / 7 Valuation of receivables and debts a) General information on capital claims Capital claims are aimed at the payment of money (loan claim, credit, etc."
2959,This also includes debt papers such as bills of exchange and checks
2960,But fixed-income securities are also included if they have no market value
2961,b) Assessment standard according to § 12 BewG The assessment standard is the nominal value (§ 12 Abs 1 BewG)
2962,"This applies to capital claims, the interest rate of which is 4 - 10 per cent"
2963,he follows
2964,"The determination of the residual nominal value of interest-bearing capital claims to be repaid in equal installments (annuity loan) has to be done with the help of the table for determining the nominal value in the case of an annuity repayment (see comment ""Valuation and Property Tax Act"" 11 edition of Rössler-Troll-Langner pages 145 and 146 )"
2965,Special circumstances must be taken into account in the assessment (e.g.
2966,High or low interest rates and non-cancellable for a longer period of time - Section 55 Paragraph 3 and 56 VStR)
2967,"Example of a low-interest capital claim that is due in one amount: Nominal value: DM 125,000 Interest rate: 225 percent"
2968,Valuation date: 1 1 1980 (term: 32 years 7 1/2 months) Net present value of the interest loss: Interest loss (175 per cent

2971,"dated June 8, 1976 - S-3103 A - 7 - St III 42 -)"
2972,"In the case of receivables in a foreign currency, the exchange rates on the respective reference date are decisive (Appendix 10 VStR 1977)"
2973,"For a valuation below the nominal value, however, the uncollectibility and uncertainty of the claim (dubious claim) are decisive"
2974,"The evaluation of a silent participation has to be done according to the regulation in section 56, paragraph 4 VStR"
2975,"Thereafter, termination must be excluded for at least 5 years"
2976,The average annual yield that can be achieved in the future is derived from the average of the last three annual yields
2977,This valuation is only possible for silent participations that belong to the other assets
2978,"Interest-free, limited-term capital claims are valued in accordance with Section 12 (3) BewG"
2979,"These are claims whose due date has only been postponed, not those that are due due to a termination that is permissible at any time (e.g."
2980,Relative loan)
2981,"If a claim is non-interest-bearing, it must be checked whether the interest-free payment is offset by economic advantages for the creditor"
2982,Tables 1 and 1a are used to facilitate the calculation of the present value (in arrears - the latter is used for a non-interest-bearing capital claim to be repaid in equal annual amounts)
2983,"Examples: A) 10,000 DM - due after 10 years (auxiliary table 1 - appendix BewG) present value = 585,430 DMB) 10,000 DM - due after 10 years and to be repaid in the same annual amounts (auxiliary table 1 a - Appendix 1 a VStR) present value = 75,376 x 10000: 100 = 753760 DMC) 50,000 DM - due after 60 years 50 years according to"
2984,"Auxiliary table 1 = 343850 DM (500 x 6877) present value for 10 years = 58543 x 343850 DM: 100 = 2013 DM (present value for 60 years) D) Interest-free capital claims over 20,000 DM on January 1, 1980 - to be repaid in equal installments at the end of each year"
2985,"The first installment is due on December 31, 1983, the last on December 31, 2002 - duration 20 years (auxiliary table 1 a) 20,000 x 59,752: 100 = DM 1195040 discounted for 3 years (redemption-free years 1980, 1981 and 1982) using auxiliary table 1 1195040 x 85161: 100 = 1017780 DMc) Valuation standard according to § 109 Paragraph 4 BewG The regulation of § 109 Paragraph 4, which applies from January 1, 1974, regulates that capital claims belonging to a commercial operation are to be set at the values ​​that are based on the principles of the tax profit determination result"
2986,As capital claims i
2987,"of Section 109 (4) BewG, all claims that are aimed at the payment of money, i.e. loan claims, credit balances, etc., come into consideration"
2988,"; So also loan claims according to § 7c EStG, §§ 16 and 17 BerlinFördG as well as tax refund and tax reimbursement claims"
2989,"So-called age-old § 7c loans, which are shown in the tax balance sheet with the memorable value of one DM, because they only lead to profit realization when they are returned, are to be valued at this value"
2990,"Demarcation issues that arise within the tax balance sheet in relation to the terms ""capital claims"" and ""value adjustments"" are to be taken into account in the same way as in the tax balance sheet when assessing capital claims according to Section 44 (3) VStR"
2991,"This ensures that when evaluating the outstanding debts, no special legal evaluations have to be carried out with regard to the composition of the del credere"
2992,The income tax regulation is simply adopted
2993,"However, the balance sheet approach must correspond to the income tax principles"
2994,"d) General information on capital debt When considering a capital debt, the question of the economic connection between the debt and an asset or"
2995,the economic unit of the commercial enterprise plays a role (possibly
2996,Deductibility when determining the business assets)
2997,"Example: Although the debt rests on the owner-occupied single-family home as a mortgage, it can be deducted as a business debt if it is economically related to the commercial operation"
2998,e) Valuation of the capital debt The regulations in § 12 Paragraph 1 to 3 BewG also apply here
2999,"According to the demands, this only includes monetary debts"
3000,The benchmark is always the nominal value (even if a discount - Damnum - was withheld)
3001,"A valuation above the nominal value takes place with very high interest and with repayment after a longer period of time (see Sections 56, Paragraph 6 and 55, Paragraph 3 VStR)"
3002,"Because of the valuation below the nominal value in the case of no interest, reference is made to Section 12 (3) BewG and in the case of very lower interest rates to Section 56 (4) VStR"
3003,"If the advantage of interest-free or low interest is offset by economic disadvantages, a valuation below par is not justified"
3004,f) Annex FR Annex FR to the wealth tax return or
3005,"for the statement of assets serves to determine the value of capital claims and capital debts, if these claims or"
3006,of these debts with the nominal value according to § 12 para 1 BewG is not considered
3007,It is therefore important to ensure that this annex is completed correctly and truthfully
3008,Comparisons with the information in Appendix FR on previous wealth tax returns and statements of assets are essential
3009,g) Assessment of claims in kind and obligations in kind Due to the changed legal situation regarding the assessment of claims in kind and obligations in kind by the case law of the BFH (judgment of 3 March 1978 - BStBl II p
3010,398) there are changes or

3014,"The calculation of the capital value should be based on the annual value determined in accordance with Section 15 (3) BewG (the amount that will likely be achieved in the future on average over the years) in accordance with Section 14 (1) BewG, if applicable"
3015,taking into account the exemption according to § 111 No. 9 BewG
3016,The Rdvfg
3017,are the rulings of the BFH of 17 May 1966 (BStBl III p
3018,500) and of 29 6 1973 (BStBl II p
3019,696)
3020,"In the judgment of May 17, 1966, the BFH examined the type of claims involved in the right to participate in the KVH's extended fee distribution on the basis of legal and statutory provisions"
3021,He stated that the claim constitutes a right to recurring uses (more correctly: services)
3022,The applicability of § 111 No. 1 and 4 BewG was denied
3023,"In the judgment of June 29, 1973, the BFH upholds its previous view"
3024,From the final sentence of his reasoning it becomes clear that he also the applicability of § 111 No. 3 BewG in particular with regard to his possibly
3025,"extended interpretation of Section 111 No. 4 BewG, but did not consider the provision to be applicable"
3026,The BFH judgment of 25 3 1977 (BStBl II p
3027,"625), which is occasionally cited to support a contrary view, does not contradict"
3028,The claims to be assessed therein are survivors' claims from compulsory professional insurance regulated by the statutes
3029,Although the deceased husband of the appellant belonged as a dentist to a dental association
3030,"However, he was compulsorily insured with a pension fund for doctors, dentists and veterinarians, which was organizationally and financially separate from the association of statutory health insurance physicians"
3031,"While a beneficiary with compulsory insurance has claims to insurance benefits in the event of a pension, the amount of which depends on the amount of the insurance premiums paid, a beneficiary who is a member of the KVH or his or her authorized family member receives recurring benefits that result from his previous professional activity"
3032,"The claims from the pension fund of doctors, dentists and veterinarians are therefore not to be equated with the claims to participation in the extended fee distribution of the KVH, so that § 111 No. 3 BewG cannot be applied to the right to recurring services from the KVH"
3033,It should be noted that claims from the extended fee distribution of the Hessen Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians are only available to statutory health insurance physicians and their survivors

3039,"V with § 105 BewG all tax debts of the taxpayer are taken into account, as far as they are not economically connected with a commercial enterprise and have therefore already been deducted when determining the business assets (Section 98 sentence 1 VStR)"
3040,"For the deductibility of tax debts when determining the total assets, the instructions in Section 37 Paragraph 2 to 4 apply accordingly (Section 98 Sentence 4 VStR)"
3041,"According to section 37 (3) sentence 1 VStR, however, the prerequisite for the deduction is that the taxpayer could count on the charge on the reference date"
3042,"In the case of annual tax liabilities, it can be assumed that this is the case in the amount of the tax assessed later and not covered by advance payments (Section 37 Paragraph 3 Sentence 2 VStR)"
3043,"Regarding the facts: If changes in the previous income tax assessment result in higher or lower tax liabilities than those that have already been taken into account in a final wealth tax assessment, a change in the wealth tax assessment can only be considered if in addition to the substantive legal requirement (existence of an economic burden on respective reference date) the procedural requirements are also met"
3044,"Since the loss shares were not taken into account in the income tax assessment, the taxpayer was initially burdened with an economic burden in the amount of the fixed income tax"
3045,"However, as of the cut-off date, he had to expect that his final economic burden would be lower, taking into account the share of losses still to be determined by the company tax offices"
3046,"If, on the other hand, the loss shares had been taken into account in the income tax assessment in accordance with his declaration, the taxpayer would have had to expect that the loss shares allotted to him would have been received by the company tax offices"
3047,higher or lower
3048,This also applies to changes in the amount of the loss shares due to tax audits carried out at the companies (modified reference date principle)
3049,"This fulfills the substantive legal requirement for deducting the lower income tax liability resulting from the (original) income tax assessment after carrying out the (original) income tax assessment in the case of wealth tax assessments on earlier reference dates, taking into account the loss shares reported later"
3050,"Insofar as the wealth tax assessment has not yet been carried out on the assessment date on which the income tax liabilities arise, this could result, taking into account the (possibly"
3051,Income tax liabilities resulting from changed) loss shares are deducted from the raw assets
3052,"However, if the wealth tax assessment became final - as in the case - a change to the assessment could only be made in compliance with the procedural regulations"
3053,The provisions of Sections 172 Paragraph 1 No. 2 173 Paragraph 1 175 Nos. 1 and 2 AO as well as Sections 164 Paragraph 1 and 165 Paragraph 1 AO come into consideration
3054,A change according to § 172 Paragraph 1 No. 2 lit.
3055,a AO may only be carried out if the taxpayer agrees to the change in the final wealth tax assessment or if his application is complied with and the change works to his disadvantage
3056,"Since the change to take account of lower income tax liabilities would work to his disadvantage, it can be assumed that the taxpayer will generally not agree to such a change"
3057,A change in the wealth tax assessment according to Section 173 Paragraph 1 No. 1 and 2 AO would only be justified by such facts that were already available when the original wealth tax assessment was issued but were not known
3058,Section 37 (4) sentence 2 VStR (this administrative instruction applies accordingly in accordance with Section 98 sentence 4 VStR for the determination of total assets) intended for the case that the additional taxes resulting from an external audit can be deducted as debts even if the standard value assessment (wealth tax assessment ) was final before the field audit was carried out
3059,"However, there is no legal basis on which such a change in the wealth tax assessment could be based"
3060,"While Rössler-Troll-Langner, Commentary on BewG and VStG, 11th edition, note"
3061,"7 on § 105 BewG, take the view that for the unit valuation (and consequently also for the wealth tax assessment) increases or reductions in tax liabilities represent a new fact that can lead to a correction of the already legally binding unit value (wealth tax assessment), represent Gürsching- Stenger, Commentary on the BewG and VStG, note"

3063,534) and of 21 8 1962 (BStBl III p
3064,"501), according to which additional payments of business taxes, which have resulted from an external audit, are in themselves not new facts within the meaning of § 222 RAO (§ 173 Paragraph 1 AO), the view that procedurally fundamentally there is no possibility of the standard value notification ( Wealth tax assessment)"
3065,Also from the rulings of the BFH of 10 5 1972 - III R 83/71 - (BStBl II S
3066,688) and III R 58/71 - (BStBl II S
3067,691) as well as the judgment of 25 5 1973 (BStBl II p
3068,"623), which concern retroactive tax back payments for business taxes and personal taxes, it cannot be inferred that the tax back payments by way of the amendment according to § 222 para 1 no 2 RAO could be taken into account when determining the unit value of business assets or in the wealth tax assessment , since the cases mentioned concerned either an initial determination or a change in the decision for other reasons or a final determination in accordance with Section 225 RAO"
3069,In the judgment of 25 6 1976 EFG 1977 p
3070,"97 ruled that neither tax refund claims nor tax debts, which could be property or"
3071,"Debt Items Affect Wealth Tax Amount, Facts i"
3072,of § 222 Paragraph 1 No. 1 RAO
3073,"The change in the wealth tax would not result directly from a fact established at Bp, but only from an assessment under tax law, which in turn is no longer a new fact"
3074,"Apart from cases that correspond to the example case cited in section 37 (4) sentence 2 VStR, it can therefore be assumed for the time being that the reduction or increase in tax liabilities or tax refund claims do not constitute facts that would change or repeal the wealth tax assessment according to § 173 para 1 No. 1 or 2 AO could justify"
3075,"In addition, according to the facts at hand, the tax office should have already considered the possibility of reducing the income tax after receiving the notification of the uniform and separate determination of the income when assessing the wealth tax"
3076,"Consequently, the income tax liability would only be at a correspondingly lower - possibly"
3077,- may deduct the amount determined in an estimate
3078,"If, on the other hand, the tax office decided to deduct the income tax liability with the amount that resulted from the state of the proceedings at the time, the subsequent reduction in income tax cannot be treated as a ""fact"" that subsequently became known"
3079,"A change in the wealth tax assessment to take account of increases or reductions in tax liabilities cannot be based on Section 175 No. 1 AO either, because the income tax assessment is not a basic assessment in relation to the wealth tax assessment"
3080,"In the § 175 AO because of the term ""basic notification"" refers to § 171 paragraph 10 AO, it is made clear that it must be an administrative act with binding effect for the tax assessment in question"
3081,Neither the Valuation Act nor the Wealth Tax Act contains such a binding regulation
3082,Tipke-Kruse (comment on AO) lead in the note
3083,"1 to § 175 AO, the basic decision establishes tax bases in the broadest sense with binding effect for the subsequent decision"
3084,"These explanations should, however, be understood in the sense that these consequences only occur if the binding effect is legally stipulated at all"
3085,There is no such regulation here
3086,The provision of No. 2 of Section 175 AO does not apply either
3087,The prerequisite for a cancellation or change would be that an event occurs that has tax effects on the past
3088,With the change in the income tax assessment and the associated reduction (or possibly
3089,"Increase) in income tax, no event has occurred that would have tax effects on the past"
3090,"As stated above, from the point of view of the modified key date principle, the taxpayer had to reckon with the final tax liability as an economic burden on the key date"
3091,The specification of the amount of tax liability through the amended or amended income tax assessment does not mean that the economic burden (the event) did not already exist in this amount on the reference date
3092,"Since the income tax ultimately owed must be viewed as the only correct debt item from the point of view of the modified reference date principle, the original (incorrect) valuation can be seen as an error in the application of the law within the meaning of Section 177 AO"
3093,The deduction of the income tax liability could therefore be corrected within the limits of Section 177 (1) and / or (2) AO if the requirements for a change in the wealth tax assessment exist for other reasons
3094,"However, if the wealth tax has been determined subject to review (Section 164 (1) AO) or with regard to the assessment of tax liabilities (Section 165 (1) AO), a change to the wealth tax assessment to take into account increases or decreases in tax liabilities is also permissible under procedural law"
3095,"However, this does not mean that all relevant wealth tax assessments should be kept open for changes with regard to a possible reduction (or increase) in income tax by applying Section 164 (1) or Section 165 (1) AO"
3096,"This conclusion could not be derived from § 85 AO, because in addition to material justice, the principle of legal certainty must also be taken into account"
3097,"It is also not overlooked that, given the tense work situation, the tax offices would hardly be in a position to constantly monitor a large number of cases to determine whether, if the income tax assessment were to be changed, all the wealth tax assessments indirectly affected by it would also have to be changed"

4358,The prerequisite for the elimination of the determination of the average rate of profit is that the number of VE sustainably exceeds the limits of Section 13a (1) No. 3 EStG
4359,"For the term sustainability, reference is made to Section 135 (4) EStR"
4360,"In the case of a gradual increase in the number of animals, it therefore depends on whether the number of animals converted into VE has been above the limits of Section 13a (1) No. 3 EStG over the three preceding financial years"
4361,"If this is the case, the requirements of Section 13a (1) No. 3 EStG are no longer met from the beginning of the fourth financial year"

4367,222 Value of the work performance The basic amount according to § 13a Abs 4 EStG is assumed that the business is managed exclusively with paid workers (see § 36 Abs 2 BewG)
4368,The value of the work performed by the business owner and his relatives who are not employed in the company on the basis of an employment relationship to be determined in accordance with Section 13a (5) EStG must therefore be added to the basic amount (Section 13a (3) No. 2 EStG)
4369,"Section 130a, Paragraphs 4 to 6 EStR must be observed here"
4370,"In detail, the following is pointed out: When determining the value of the work performance for the physical work of the business owner and the relatives who are not employed, only the work performance is to be taken into account in the result, which is based on the area recorded in the initial value according to § 13a para 4 EStG in the individual case not applicable"
4371,The paid workers are to be counted towards the appropriate number of full-time workers (VAK) according to the duration of their employment (§ 13a Abs 5 Nr 5 EStG)
4372,"This also applies to temporary workers employed on a short-term basis, as well as to workers who have been made available by contractors for certain ordering, maintenance or harvesting work"

4651,"The section ""Sale / Withdrawal of Land"" contains the essential basic information required to examine profits from sales and withdrawals"
4652,"If the required information can be clearly found in the individual case from the balance sheet or similar documents, a reference in Annex L to the relevant documents is sufficient"

4684,2415 - BStBl 1987 I p
4685,4) provide for investment grants for certain investments
4686,The investment grants are granted from income tax or corporation tax
4687,The Investment Allowance Act and Section 19 BerlinFG are tax laws
4688,The terms used therein are to be interpreted in accordance with the principles governing income taxation (BFH rulings of 25 1 1985 - BStBl II p
4689,309 and from 15 11 1985 - BStBl 1986 II p
4690,367)
4691,The aforementioned laws agree in numerous individual provisions; Supreme court decisions on such individual provisions therefore apply in principle to both the Investment Allowance Act and Section 19 BerlinFG
4692,"With regard to the application of § 4b InvZulG 1982 in connection with §§ 5 and 5a InvZulG 1982 in the version of the announcement of June 4, 1982 (Federal Law Gazette I p"

4697,97) and from 27 11 1986 (BStBl I p
4698,547) as well as the corresponding decrees of the highest tax authorities of the states
4699,When applying Sections 1 4 and 4a InvZulG 1986 in conjunction with Sections 5 5a and 8 InvZulG 1986 and Sections 19 and 20 BerlinFG 1987 in conjunction with Section 31 (19) BerlinFG 1987 apply with reference to the result of the discussions the following principles with the highest financial authorities of the federal states: Part One Common Principles A
4700,Substantive legal provisions I Eligible persons 1 General 1 (1) Unrestricted and limited taxpayers within the meaning of the Income Tax Act and the Corporation Tax Act as well as companies within the meaning of Section 15 (1) No. 2 EStG that make business investments in Germany are entitled to claim investment grants
4701,"If the civil and economic owner of a manufactured or purchased item is not the same person, the investment allowance is to be granted to the beneficial owner (BFH judgment of 2 6 1978 - BStBl II p"
4702,507)
4703,2 (2) In cases of universal succession (e.g.
4704,"Inheritance, transfer of assets within the meaning of the Transformation Act), the legal successor takes the position of his legal predecessor with regard to the entitlement to claim"
4705,"This also applies if a business or partial business is transferred free of charge (Section 7 (1) EStDV) or incorporated into a corporation or partnership in accordance with Section 20 or Section 24 UmwStG; In these cases, the legal successor is entitled to the investment allowance, unless the legal predecessor has legitimately applied for it"
4706,It follows that the legal successor can claim the investment allowance even if the conditions are partly fulfilled by him and partly by his legal predecessor
4707,3 (3) The granting of the investment allowance does not depend on a specific type of profit determination
4708,"Eligible beneficiaries are therefore also eligible, whose profit is determined in accordance with Section 4 (3) EStG or average rates"
4709,2 Taxpayers within the meaning of the Income Tax Act and the Corporation Tax Act 4 (1) Eligibility does not require that the taxpayer is assessed with an amount or at all for income tax or corporation tax
4710,"Corporations, associations of persons and estates exempt from corporation tax are entitled to claim the investment allowance, provided that they maintain an economic business and the other requirements (cf."
4711,20 and 21)
4712,5 (2) The taxpayers within the meaning of the Corporate Income Tax Act can also include legal entities under public law
4713,The granting of an investment allowance is only possible if they run a business of a commercial nature (Section 1 (1) No. 6 and Section 4 KStG)
4714,"Because of the concept of commercial operation, reference is made to Section 5 KStR"
4715,"6 (3) In the case of group relationships within the meaning of Sections 14 to 19 KStG, either the controlling company or the subsidiary company is entitled to claim, depending on who fulfills the requirements for the granting of the investment allowance"
4716,"3 Partnerships and communities 7 (1) The eligible companies within the meaning of Section 15 (1) No. 2 EStG also include internal companies that are co-entrepreneurs, e.g."
4717,atypical silent societies
4718,"8 (2) The regulation on the entitlement of companies within the meaning of Section 15 (1) No. 2 EStG applies accordingly to companies whose profits from agriculture, forestry or self-employed work are attributable to several participants (see Section 13 (5) and Section 18 (1)) 5 EStG)"
4719,"9 (3) In the case of assets that belong to the special business assets of one or more shareholders, the partnership is entitled to claim"
4720,10 (4) General partnerships and limited partnerships that receive income from capital assets or from renting and leasing are not eligible because they have no business assets; the same applies to the investment funds of investment companies
4721,"11 (5) Working groups, machine and laboratory groups are only to be treated as independent beneficiaries of the investment allowance if they do not fall under Section 180 (4) AO and Section 2a GewStG, i.e."
4722,if a separate determination of the income subject to income tax and income subject to corporation tax is to be made for them
4723,"If an asset is acquired or manufactured by several beneficiaries for the business purposes of the co-owners without a separate determination being made, each co-owner is entitled to claim the investment allowance on a pro rata basis"
4724,"II Beneficiary investments 1 General 12 (1) In the case of the individual investment grants with different requirements, 1 the acquisition and production of new, wear-and-tear movable fixed assets (§§ 1 4 and 4a InvZulG, § 19 BerlinFG) are considered as beneficiary investments , 2 the production of depreciable immovable fixed assets (§§ 1 4 and 4a InvZulG, § 19 BerlinFG), 3 extensions and extensions to buildings or parts of buildings belonging to the fixed assets (§§ 1 4 and 4a InvZulG, § 19 BerlinFG), 4 Expansion and expansion of district heating networks as well as the acquisition and production of certain systems (Section 4a InvZulG), 5 other subsequent production work on wear-and-tear immovable fixed assets (Section 19 BerlinFG), 6 the acquisition of new, depreciable, intangible fixed assets (Section 4 InvZulG )"
4725,13 (2) The granting of an investment allowance is not excluded because the asset was manufactured abroad
4726,2 Term and time of acquisition or manufacture 14 (1) Acquisition is the purchase of an asset from a third party for a fee
4727,The transfer of an asset from current assets or from private assets to fixed assets is not a purchase (BFH judgment of 29 7 1966 - BStBl 1967 III p
4728,62)
4729,"The acquisition or manufacture of an asset can, however, be assumed if an asset that has been acquired or manufactured for the current assets is clearly before the end of the same calendar or"
4730,Financial year is transferred to fixed assets (BFH judgment of 11 12 1970 - BStBl 1971 II p
4731,198)
4732,15 (2) The time of purchase is the time of delivery (§ 9a EStDV)
4733,"According to this, an asset is acquired at the point in time at which the purchaser can dispose of it economically according to the will of the contracting parties"
4734,"This is usually the case when ownership, risk, benefits and burdens are transferred to the purchaser (see BFH judgment of 28 4 1977 - BStBl II p"
4735,553)
4736,"If the subject of a purchase contract for an asset is its assembly by the seller, the asset is usually only delivered once the assembly work has been completed"
4737,"If the assembly is carried out by the beneficiary himself or by a third party on his behalf, the time of delivery is the time at which the beneficiary has taken over the asset from the supplier"
4738,26 remains unaffected
4739,16 (3) Production is the creation of a previously non-existent asset
4740,The production of an asset is completed at the time it is completed (Section 9a EStDV)
4741,An asset is completed as soon as it can be used for its intended purpose
4742,"On the question of the completion of buildings that are erected in construction phases, see the BFH judgment of 15 July 1977 (BStBl II p"
4743,845)
4744,3 Definition of fixed assets 17 (1) Fixed assets only include assets that are intended to serve the company on a permanent basis
4745,"If the intended purpose of an asset cannot be clearly determined, the accounting justifies a presumption (see Section 41c Paragraph 1 EStR)"
4746,(2) Repair materials and spare parts are not included in fixed assets
4747,Something else only applies if it is the initial supply of spare or spare parts that were supplied or produced with the delivery or production of the asset
4748,19 (3) Assets that are acquired or manufactured before the start of business activity belong to fixed assets from the time of acquisition or manufacture if they are intended to serve the business on a permanent basis when they are delivered or completed (see BFH rulings from 30 9 1960 - BStBl III p
4749,489 and from 3 11 1961 - BStBl 1962 III S
4750,123)
4751,This requirement can be regarded as fulfilled if the operational activity is started within one year after delivery or completion of the asset
4752,"20 (4) In the case of corporations, associations of persons and estates within the meaning of Section 1 Paragraph 1 No. 3 to 5 KStG, fixed assets can only be present if they are economically related to income within the meaning of Section 2 Paragraph 1 No. 1 to 3 EStG"
4753,Legal persons under public law can only have fixed assets in their businesses of a commercial nature (cf.
4754,"21 (5) Corporations, associations of persons and estates exempt from corporation tax are only entitled to claim the investment allowance if they maintain an economic business with income within the meaning of Section 2 (1) No. 1 to 3 EStG (cf."
4755,The prerequisite for claiming the investment allowance is therefore that the fixed assets can be allocated to commercial operations
4756,This also applies if it is a purpose-built establishment within the meaning of Sections 65 to 68 AO
4757,"4 Beneficiary assets a) Wearable movable assets aa) Term 22 Because of the term wearable movable assets, reference is made to Section 43 (3) EStR"
4758,bb) Mixing and combining of movable assets with other assets 23 (1) Assets that are built into a building belonging to the fixed assets are usually not counted as movable assets (BFH judgment of 17 5 1968 - BStBl II p
4759,563)
4760,"For the acquisition or production costs of such assets, an investment allowance can therefore only be considered as part of subsidized construction costs for the building or subsidized subsequent construction costs for a building"
4761,This applies e.g.
4762,"for floor coverings that are fully bonded and that cannot be separated from the building without the risk of considerable damage, and for floor coverings that are loosely laid on concrete or another substrate that is usually not yet to be regarded as a finished floor"
4763,"If, on the other hand, a floor covering is laid loosely on a floor that is usually usable, it is regularly to be regarded as a movable asset"
4764,All connected floor coverings laid in a room are to be regarded as an economic asset
4765,"24 (2) Operating equipment (Section 43 Paragraph 3 EStR) and dummy components belong, contrary to No."
4766,23 are also classified as movable fixed assets if they are installed in a building belonging to the fixed assets
4767,A sham component arises when movable assets are inserted into a building for a temporary purpose through construction work (§ 95 BGB)
4768,"An insertion for a temporary purpose is to be assumed if the inserted movable assets represent a considerable re-use value even after their removal and, according to the circumstances, in particular the type and purpose of the connection, it can be expected that the installed assets will be removed again later ( see BFH judgments of 24 November 1970 - BStBl 1971 II p"
4769,157 and from 4 12 1970 - BStBl 1971 II p
4770,165)
4771,Sham components are not given if the expected useful life of the installed movable assets is no longer than the period for which they are installed
4772,Leasehold improvements or conversions can also be operating fixtures or dummy components (BMF letter of 15 1 1976 - BStBl II p
4773,66 and the corresponding decrees of the highest tax authorities of the federal states)
4774,"25 (3) Regarding the treatment of expenses incurred by a tenant or other beneficial owner for construction work, which do not result in fictitious components or operating equipment, but which are to be treated as manufacturing costs of a wear-and-tear, immovable asset, reference is made to No."
4775,33 referenced
4776,"26 (4) If a new movable asset is acquired or manufactured that is intended to be mixed or firmly connected with another movable asset, the acquisition or manufacture of such an asset is favored if, despite the mixing or combining, its property as retains independent movable assets as fixed assets"
4777,"If the economic good becomes a dependent part of another movable asset by mixing or combining, then a benefit for the acquisition or production costs of the asset is only possible as part of the acquisition or production costs for the other beneficiary movable asset or as part of the subsequent production costs ( BFH rulings of 20 3 1981 - BStBl II p"
4778,"785, dated 27 11 1981 - BStBl 1982 II p"
4779,176 and from 4 12 1981 - BStBl 1984 II p
4780,630)
4781,"cc) New assets (1) A movable asset that the claimant has produced himself is always to be regarded as ""new"" if the partial value of the used assets used in the production is 10%"
4782,does not exceed the partial value of the economic good produced (BFH judgment of 4 8 1983 - BStBl 1984 II p
4783,631)
4784,A movable economic good is always new if a new idea is realized during production and a different type of economic good is created that helps the company compete
4785,Then z
4786,"Construction, tool and machine shacks made from used containers new economic goods (BFH judgment of 12 6 1975 - BStBl 1976 II p"
4787,96)
4788,"In contrast, an inland waterway vessel composed of the front and rear of two used ships is not a new economic asset (BFH judgment of 8 2 1980 - BStBl II p"
4789,341)
4790,"28 (2) If a movable asset is acquired, it is ""new"" if it is acquired in an unused condition and the manufacturer meets the requirements that are necessary for the acceptance of a new asset in self-production (brand new)"
4791,An asset is still new if the partial value of the used assets installed in the immediate temporal and material connection with its purchase is 10%
4792,does not exceed the partial value of the uniform asset (BFH judgment of 4 12 1981 - BStBl 1984 II p
4793,630)
4794,"If a brand-new asset is initially used on a rental basis and later bought by the tenant, taking into account the rent paid, the asset is not new at the time of purchase (see BFH rulings of 24 5 1968 - BStBl II p"
4795,571)
4796,Something else applies if the intention to purchase and prior testing are part of the contract and the rental period does not exceed the time appropriate for a testing (BFH judgment of 16 1 1986 - BStBl II p
4797,467)
4798,29 (3) An asset is also not new if it was used for demonstration purposes prior to acquisition (BFH judgment of 13 3 1979 - BStBl II p
4799,287)
4800,"In contrast, testing by the manufacturer to check the functionality of the asset is harmless if it does not go beyond what is necessary"
4801,"The condition ""new"" does not conflict with the fact that the asset is technically out of date or has been stored for a long time"
4802,"dd) Low-value and short-lived assets, depreciation allowances 30 (1) For low-value assets within the meaning of Section 6 (2) EStG, an investment allowance is not granted even if the freedom of valuation is not used"
4803,31 (2) The granting of an investment allowance is not excluded for wear-and-tear moveable fixed assets because their useful life does not exceed 1 year (BFH judgment of 13 3 1979 - BStBl II p
4804,578) or because in the year of acquisition or production due to depreciation allowances (e.g.
4805,according to § 4 No. 1 Inventor's Ordinance) or valued on the basis of § 6 Abs 1 No. 1 EStG with a partial value of 1 DM (BFH judgment of 28 10 1977 - BStBl 1978 II p
4806,115)
4807,"b) Depreciable immovable assets 32 (1) Depreciable immovable assets include in particular 1 buildings, condominiums and partially owned rooms, 2 independent building parts within the meaning of Section 13b EStR, 3 outdoor facilities such as fences and ground reinforcements (e"

4824,152 6 Intangible assets 37 For intangible assets - with the exception of the cases of Section 4 (2) No. 3 InvZulG - an investment allowance is not granted because they belong neither to movable nor immovable assets (BFH rulings of 6 8 1964 - BStBl III p
4825,575 and from 22 5 1979 - BStBl II p

4827,"With regard to the concept of an intangible asset, please refer to Section 31a EStR"
4828,7 Movable assets that are used exclusively or almost exclusively for operational purposes 38 (1) An investment allowance can in principle also be granted if the external use of up to 10%
4829,of the total use (BFH judgments of 4 11 1977 - BStBl 1978 II p

4834,This does not apply if exclusive use for specific operational purposes is required by law (cf. § 4 Paragraph 2 No. 1 and § 4a Paragraph 3 InvZulG as well as § 19 Paragraph 1 No. 1 Letter b BerlinFG)
4835,"39 (2) If an employer gives his employee a motor vehicle for use within the framework of the employment relationship, it will be used in the employer's business to that extent"

4842,"However, this does not always require that the economic asset must remain in the spatially delimited area of ​​the establishment (the establishment)"
4843,According to No.
4844,"113 and 174 to 185, an investment allowance can therefore also be considered for economic goods which, by their nature, are not intended to be used in the company (in the permanent establishment) of the beneficiary"
4845,"Insofar as the BFH decisions of May 23, 1986 on Section 4b InvZulG 1982 (BStBl II p"
4846,"916 and 918) go beyond these exceptions, they cannot be transferred to the cases of §§ 1 4 and 4a InvZulG and § 19 BerlinFG"

4857,45 (6) In the event of a business split (see BMF letter of 10 12 1985 - BStBl I S
4858,"683 as well as the corresponding decrees of the highest tax authorities of the federal states), it is harmless if favored assets of the holding company are used within the three-year period in a permanent establishment of the operating company"
4859,"In these cases, the holding company is entitled to claim the investment allowance"
4860,It is irrelevant whether the business split already exists or is being newly established
4861,The same applies to the transfer of assets between the owner and operating company
4862,46 (7) A harmful transfer of the business (the permanent establishment) within the meaning of no
4863,42 No. 1 letter b is equivalent to a 100% change of shareholders in a partnership if it takes place in a uniform economic process (see BFH judgment of 25 7 1968 - BStBl II p

4867,47 (8) A detrimental interruption of the three-year period occurs in any case when the company (permanent establishment) ceases its advertising activity
4868,Only the opening of bankruptcy or the decision to liquidate without cessation of the advertising activity is harmless
4869,48 (9) A harmful interruption of the three-year period is also to be assumed if assets leave the permanent establishment prematurely for reasons that are only in the permanent establishment (see BFH judgment of 14 10 1977 - Federal Tax Gazette 1978 II p
4870,204)
4871,This is e.g.
4872,"the case if assets are sold before the end of the relevant three-year period due to a business changeover, even if the business changeover is due to a fire in the premises (BFH judgment of 2 5 1980 - BStBl II p"
4873,758)
4874,49 (10) A premature withdrawal of assets is to be regarded as harmless as an exception if the useful life of the asset has expired (cf. BFH judgment of 9 3 1967 - BStBl III p
4875,"238), due to force majeure (e.g."
4876,"by fire, theft, etc."
4877,) or through economic consumption or a total loss (BFH judgments of 15 10 1976 - BStBl 1977 II p
4878,59 and from 1 7 1977 - BStBl II p
4879,793) is initiated
4880,The same applies to a movable asset that is exchanged for another of the same or better quality because it is defective and therefore cannot be used in the company (BFH judgment of 8 3 1968 - BStBl II p
4881,430)
4882,"9 Obligation to record 50 (1) The granting of an investment allowance in accordance with the Investment Allowance Act presupposes that the beneficiary investments have been recorded in a special register, stating the date of delivery or completion and the acquisition, production or subsequent production costs, unless this information is provided are evident from the bookkeeping or from the application for investment allowance"
4883,"51 (2) If the investment allowance is already used for down payments or partial production costs, paragraph 1 applies accordingly"
4884,III Calculation of the investment allowance 1 Assessment base a) General 52 (1) The investment allowance is granted for the investments that are benefited from a financial year
4885,It must be measured separately for each type of investment allowance
4886,The assessment basis is the sum of the acquisition or production costs for eligible movable assets that were delivered or completed in the financial year
4887,"Production costs for subsidized immovable assets that were completed in the financial year, production costs for subsidized subsequent production work that was completed in the financial year, and acquisition costs for subsidized intangible assets that were delivered in the financial year (§ 4 InvZulG)"
4888,The assessment basis can also include the advance payments made in the financial year for acquisition costs for preferential movable assets and the partial production costs incurred in the financial year for eligible movable and immovable assets and for favorable subsequent production work
4889,"In these cases, in the financial year of delivery or completion of the assets or the termination of subsequent production work, only the acquisition or production costs less the down payments or partial production costs are part of the assessment basis"
4890,"53 (2) If assets are admissibly valued at a fixed value, the acquisition or production costs of these assets and not the fixed value must be taken into account when determining the assessment basis (see BFH judgment of 29 7 1966 - BStBl 1967 III p"
4891,151)
4892,54 (3) The provision of Section 4 (5) No. 7 EStG must be taken into account when determining the assessment basis (BFH judgment of 19 6 1975 - BStBl 1976 II p
4893,97)
4894,"This means that, in the case of the investment allowance, that part of the acquisition or production costs of an economic good affecting the way of life may not be included in the assessment basis which, according to the general public opinion, is to be regarded as inappropriate and is therefore not deductible business expenses according to Section 4 (5) No. 7 EStG"
4895,Section 20 (22) sentence 2 EStR and the BFH rulings of 2 2 1979 (BStBl II p
4896,387) and from 2 2 1980 (BStBl II p
4897,340) is pointed out
4898,"55 (4) The acquisition or production costs as well as the down payments on the acquisition costs, the partial production costs and the subsequent production costs are paid for by subsidies from public or private funds (see Section 34 of the Income Tax Regulation) and by the transfer of hidden reserves (e.g."
4899,due to § 6b EStG or section 35 EStR) not reduced
4900,"56 (5) For the question of whether sales tax is part of the acquisition or production costs, Section 9b EStG must be observed"
4901,b) Acquisition costs 57 (1) Acquisition costs are all expenses that are incurred in order to acquire an asset and to get it ready for operation
4902,"In addition to the purchase price, minus the purchase price reductions, this includes all expenses in connection with the acquisition and relocation of the asset to an operational state, provided that they can be individually assigned to the asset"
4903,"The acquisition costs do not include the financing (fundraising) costs, such as"
4904,"Loan costs, partial payment surcharges (see BFH judgment of 24 5 1968 - BStBl II p"
4905,574)
4906,58 (2) Acquisition costs for an asset that arise after the end of the financial year in which it is delivered must be taken into account when calculating the investment allowance for the financial year in which it was delivered
4907,"However, it is not objectionable if such acquisition costs are only claimed for the financial year in which they arise"
4908,"59 (3) The acquisition costs are reduced through price reductions (discounts, rebates or similar) (BFH judgment of 13 August 1957 - BStBl III p"
4909,349)
4910,Voluntarily returned price reductions do not increase the acquisition costs (BFH judgment of 12 3 1976 - BStBl II p
4911,527)
4912,"60 (4) In the case of purchase transactions in a foreign currency, the assessment basis for the investment allowance is the purchase price converted into German marks at the rate at the time of purchase (BFH judgment of 16 12 1977 - BStBl 1978 II p"
4913,233)
4914,"c) Production costs 61 (1) Because of the concept of production costs, reference is made to Sections 33, 33a and 58 of the Income Tax Regulation"
4915,"According to this, production costs are all expenses that arise from the consumption of goods and the use of services for the production of an asset"
4916,"The production costs of an asset therefore also include the acquisition costs of movable assets, insofar as they are purchased as intended for the production of an asset (BFH judgment of 20 3 1981 - BStBl II p"
4917,785)
4918,"For production costs that are incurred in the economic context of the production, but after the completion of an asset, e.g."
4919,"Expenses for the external plastering of a building, No."
4920,58 accordingly
4921,"62 (2) Expenses that can, but do not have to be included in the production costs according to Section 33 EStR, are included in the production costs for the assessment of the investment allowance if they have been treated as part of the production costs by the beneficiary for income taxation"
4922,The right to choose whether expenses should or should not be included in the production costs of an asset can therefore only be exercised uniformly for the investment allowance and for income taxation
4923,63 (3) Immovable fixed assets are only favored if the beneficiary has incurred manufacturing costs for them
4924,Therefore only the production and not the acquisition of immovable assets is favored
4925,Manufacturing costs are also involved in the construction of prefabricated houses and other prefabricated buildings
4926,"If immovable fixed assets have been acquired in an unfinished state, only the expenses of the purchaser for completion are included in the production costs"
4927,As far as the BFH judgment of 19 7 1979 (BStBl 1980 II p
4928,"3) if something else results, this judgment does not apply beyond the decided case"
4929,"d) Advance payments 64 Because of the concept of advance payments on acquisition costs and because of the point in time at which an advance payment was made, reference is made to Section 45 (4) EStR and Section 7a (2) sentences 3 to 5 EStG"
4930,e) Partial production costs 65 (1) Partial production costs are the expenses incurred up to the end of the financial year through the consumption of goods and the use of services for the production of an asset (BFH judgment of 15 November 1985 - BStBl 1986 II p
4931,367)
4932,It is irrelevant whether or not corresponding payments have already been made in the financial year
4933,The partial production costs of a building also include the expenses for the construction material delivered to the construction site by the end of the financial year but not yet installed
4934,66 (2) Advance payments on partial production costs are not favored (BFH judgment of 10 3 1982 - BStBl II p
4935,426)
4936,"Even in the case of partial payments by a claimant to an entrepreneur whom he has commissioned to produce a building object as a general contractor at a fixed price, only the partial production costs actually incurred are therefore included in the assessment basis"
4937,"As far as the partial payments are based on the construction progress, they can serve as a guide for the amount of the partial production costs incurred for reasons of simplification"
4938,f) Production costs for subsequent production work 67 To the extent that subsequent production work is favored (see no
4939,"34 136 to 138 and 152), the production costs for the subsequent production work are also part of the assessment basis for the investment allowance"
4940,"Because of the concept of production costs, reference is made to No."
4941,61 to 63 pointed out
4942,"Production costs for subsequent production work are also acquisition-related expenses, which are to be treated as production costs in accordance with Section 157 (5) EStR"
4943,1 Amount of the investment allowance 68 The investment allowance is calculated separately for each financial year and for each type of investment allowance
4944,"The following overview shows the amount of the individual investment allowances, based on the assessment base or the relevant part of the assessment base: a) Investment allowance according to § 1 InvZulG aa) for investments in the border area 10%"

4955,"Due to special features of the individual investment grants, reference is made to No."
4956,127 to 132 as well as paragraphs
4957,187 190 209 and 215 to 217 pointed out
4958,"3 Cumulation of investment grants 69 The investment grants according to §§ 1 4 and 4a InvZulG can be granted for an asset, an expansion or an extension side by side"
4959,"The investment allowance according to § 19 BerlinFG can be granted in addition to an investment allowance according to § 4a InvZulG, but not in addition to an investment allowance according to § 1 or § 4 InvZulG"
4960,"Procedural regulations I Application 1 Application deadline 70 The application for investment allowance can only be submitted up to 9 months after the end of the calendar year in which the financial year of the acquisition or manufacture of beneficial assets, the termination of beneficial subsequent manufacturing work or the preferential advance payments on acquisition costs or the favored partial production costs ends (Section 5 (3) sentence 3 InvZulG, Section 19 (5) sentence 3 BerlinFG)"
4961,This also applies to preferential investments that have already been made before the opening of operations (cf.
4962,"Failure to meet the statutory application deadline leads to the loss of the right to apply, unless reinstatement in the previous status is to be granted in accordance with Section 110 AO (see BFH judgment of 7 11 1975 - BStBl 1976 II p"

4974,"In the application, the assets and subsequent production work for which an investment allowance is claimed must be specified in sufficient detail within the application period so that they can be determined during a follow-up examination"
4975,This also applies in the event that an investment allowance is requested for down payments on acquisition costs or for partial production costs (BFH judgment of 30 3 1979 - BStBl II p
4976,450)
4977,The application is only effective if it has been signed by the claimant or his representative within the application period
4978,An application signed by the representative of the beneficiary within the application period must be supplemented by the personal signature of the beneficiary before the investment allowance notice is issued
4979,"This handwritten signature cannot be dispensed with, as the declarations of intent required in the application form (e.g."

4984,"74 (3) If the application for investment allowance does not list economic goods or subsequent production work during the financial year, their designation can be made up within the application period"
4985,"However, this only applies as long as a decision on the investment subsidy has not yet been issued for the financial year or can still be changed according to the procedural regulations (see BFH judgment of 19 10 1984 - BStBl 1985 II p"
4986,63)
4987,"75 (4) The application must also state all further eligibility requirements, in particular the acquisition costs, production costs, down payments on acquisition costs and partial production costs of the beneficiary investments for which the investment allowance is requested"
4988,"This information can also be retrieved, supplemented or corrected after the application period has expired, as long as an investment allowance notice has not yet been issued for the financial year or can still be changed according to the procedural regulations"
4989,"II Granting of the investment allowance 1 certification procedure (§§ 2 4 and 4a InvZulG) 76 (1) In the cases of § 1 in conjunction with § 2 InvZulG, § 4 Paragraph 2 No. 3 InvZulG and § 4a InvZulG, an investment allowance is granted Not only dependent on tax law, but also on business law requirements (cf."
4990,100 122 and 133)
4991,The decision that the commercial law requirements are met is made by issuing a certificate
4992,This certificate is a substantive prerequisite for the granting of the investment allowance (see BFH decision of 25 5 1976 - BStBl II p
4993,564)
4994,77 (2) The economic authorities are solely responsible for deciding on the economic law requirements

5000,538)
5001,"Since the certificate is a non-tax administrative act, the tax statute of limitations does not apply to it"
5002,The certificate can therefore still be issued or withdrawn after the deadlines set for basic tax assessments have expired
5003,The certificate is binding as long as it is not withdrawn in whole or in part by the responsible economic authorities
5004,"79 (4) If the tax office determines that the commercial law requirements specified in the certificate are obviously not present or that a condition subsequent in the certificate has occurred or a condition has not been met, it must cause the issuing authority to review the certificate"
5005,"80 (5) If the tax office determines that the investment project certified in accordance with § 2 InvZulG and the investment project carried out are not identical in terms of location, type and scope, or if there is any doubt as to their identity, the certification authority shall have the authority to review the certificate issued request (see Section 2 Paragraph 6 InvZulG)"
5006,Doubts can arise in particular if there are significant deviations from the investments specified in the application for the issuance of the certificate with regard to the type of investments carried out or if the investment amount specified in the certificate is significantly higher or lower than the sum that is decisive for the assessment of the investment allowance Acquisition or manufacturing costs of the beneficiary investments

5009,"If the tax office has doubts about the identity, it must ask the certification authority to review the certificate issued"
5010,"2 Determination procedure a) Responsible tax office 82 (1) The tax office responsible for granting the investment subsidy is of § 15 Paragraph 1 No. 2 EStG and in the case of companies whose profits from agriculture and forestry or self-employed work are attributable to several participants, the tax office responsible for the separate determination of the income (§ 18 Paragraph 1 No. 1 to 3 in conjunction with § 180 Paragraph 1 No. 2 Letter a AO)"

5223,Investment allowance for certain investments in the field of energy generation and distribution according to § 4a InvZulG I overview 133 or heat recovery system within the meaning of Section 4a (3) InvZulG is particularly suitable for saving energy
5224,This also includes the fact that the technical system is related to the construction or expansion of one of the energy generation or energy distribution systems specified in Section 4a Paragraph 1 Clause 1 No. 1 InvZulG
5225,This requirement must be proven by means of a certificate (cf.
5226,76 to 81)
5227,"134 (2) In addition to the certificate, the tax law prerequisites include the following: 1 The technical systems specified in the certificate - with the exception of the systems within the meaning of Section 4a Paragraph 3 InvZulG - are independent assets or expanded or newly manufactured parts of an immovable asset or a district heating network are (cf."
5228,"135 to 137), 2 the expenses for the purchased or manufactured assets, for the expanded or newly manufactured parts as well as for systems within the meaning of Section 4a (3) InvZulG are acquisition or manufacturing costs (cf."
5229,"138), 3 the purchased or manufactured assets, the expanded or newly manufactured parts and the systems within the meaning of Section 4a Paragraph 3 InvZulG remain in the taxpayer's business for at least three years after their acquisition or manufacture (cf."
5230,139) and 4 the systems referred to in Section 4a (3) InvZulG are used exclusively to generate electricity or heat or are used for waste heat recovery during the three-year remaining period (cf.

5232,"II Beneficial investments according to § 4a InvZulG 1 Beneficial assets, expanded or newly manufactured parts and systems 135 Newly manufactured parts of immovable assets, expanded or newly manufactured parts of district heating networks or solar, wind power or heat recovery systems"
5233,The tax office determines whether there is an independent asset or an expanded or newly manufactured part of an immovable asset or a district heating network
5234,136 (2) The preferential treatment of district heating networks includes both the expansion of a district heating network planned as a single economic asset and the expansion and strengthening of an existing network
5235,"The district heating network technically includes the distribution systems up to the connection to the heating system of the building, i"
5236,"including the branch line into the building and the transfer station for the building with all necessary fittings, valves and heat exchangers"
5237,"For other heat distribution systems, e.g."

5255,Investment allowance for investments in Berlin (West) according to § 19 BerlinFG I Overview 141 (1) An investment allowance according to § 19 BerlinFG is granted 1 for movable assets (cf.
5256,"22 to 31), 2 for immovable assets that are buildings, parts of buildings, condominiums or rooms that are partially owned (cf."
5257,"32), 3 for the expansion and expansion of immovable assets designated under number 2 (cf."
5258,34) and 4 for other subsequent manufacturing work on immovable assets designated under number 2 (cf.
5259,152)
5260,Subsequent manufacturing work on movable assets (cf.
5261,26) are not favored
5262,142 (2) The investment allowance according to § 19 BerlinFG is generally 10% for movable assets
5263,of acquisition or production costs and for preferential immovable assets 20%
5264,the manufacturing costs; An increased investment allowance is granted for assets that serve certain privileged purposes (cf.
5265,143 (3) The granting of an investment allowance according to § 19 BerlinFG is only dependent on tax law requirements

5269,II Basic funding 1 Movable economic goods a) General 145 An investment allowance can be considered for movable economic goods for the purchase and manufacture
5270,"b) Passenger vehicles 146 (1) An investment allowance can only be granted for passenger vehicles if, at least three years after their acquisition or manufacture in the company's own commercial operation, they are used exclusively 1 to transport people for a fee or 2 are rented to self-drivers or 3 are used for driving school purposes (Section 19 (2) sentences 1 and 2 BerlinFG)"
5271,An investment allowance cannot be considered for passenger vehicles that are used as a freelance driver for driving school purposes
5272,For passenger vehicles that are rented to self-drivers (cf.
5273,"149), an investment allowance must also be granted if the passenger vehicles are used by the tenants in whole or in part for private purposes"
5274,147 (2) Use for the beneficiary purposes also exists insofar as passenger vehicles are used to the usual extent for journeys that are caused by the beneficiary use (cf.
5275,146 sentence 1) are absolutely necessary (e.g.
5276,"Trips to the company, to refueling, to the workshop, to the TÜV)"
5277,"On the other hand, use in addition to those mentioned in paragraph"
5278,146 is detrimental to other operational purposes and leads to the refusal of the investment allowance (e.g.
5279,"Rental to third parties - except for self-drivers, see no"
5280,"149 - or transfer to third parties, even if the third party uses the passenger vehicle in its commercial operation for the beneficiary purposes)"
5281,"Use for own private purposes in addition to use exclusively for the beneficiary operational purposes is, however, harmless if it exceeds the limit of 10%"
5282,of the total usage (BFH judgment of 31 July 1981 - BStBl II p

5286,"for trips to refuel, to the workshop and to the TÜV and to 9%"
5287,"used by the owner of the driving school (tradesman) for their own private purposes (shopping trips, visiting trips, vacation trips)"
5288,An investment allowance can be granted for the passenger car
5289,"Example 2: Situation as in Example 1 The owner of the driving school does not use the car for his own private purposes, but leaves it to an employed driving instructor (occasionally, for a fee or free of charge) for his private purposes"
5290,The proportion of use by the driving instructor is 9%
5291,The transfer to the employee is indeed operational; but it does not belong to the favored operational purposes
5292,An investment allowance cannot be granted for the passenger car
5293,Example 3: A passenger vehicle becomes 87 percent
5294,"for rent to self-drivers, to 4 percent"
5295,"to trips to refuel, to the workshop and to the TÜV and to 9 v"
5296,used by the owner of the company for their own private purposes
5297,The tenants also include those who use the passenger vehicle in whole or in part for private purposes
5298,Private use by tenants is not harmful (see no
5299,146)
5300,An investment allowance can be granted for the passenger car
5301,148 (3) The distinction between passenger vehicles and other motor vehicles is for the purposes of the investment allowance according to § 19 BerlinFG according to the definition in § 10 paragraph 2 of the Motor Vehicle Tax Act 1972 in the version valid until 1978 (BStBl 1972 I p
5302,551) (see BFH rulings of 23 August 1966 - BStBl 1967 III p

5304,864)
5305,"According to this, passenger vehicles are vehicles which, according to their design and equipment, are suitable and intended for the transport of no more than seven people (including the driver); this also applies if goods are transported in the passenger vehicle or in a trailer carried by it"
5306,"A motor vehicle that, after its construction, is also set up and intended to transport goods in addition to people, either or at the same time, is not to be regarded as a passenger vehicle if the usable area for transporting goods is greater than 2 1/2 square meters"
5307,"The usable area also includes the area that is created by removing seats, but not the area that is set up and intended for the transport of luggage outside the car body"
5308,It does not matter whether the vehicle is actually used to transport people or whether it is used exclusively or partially for other purposes; The only decisive factor is the objective structural condition of the motor vehicle

5319,875) are given
5320,"According to this ordinance, rental to self-drivers exists if a motor vehicle is rented commercially without providing a driver and this activity has been reported in writing to the supervisory authority"
5321,The rental to self-drivers can also take place within the framework of a commercial enterprise that has other activities as its subject
5322,"However, the prerequisite for the preferential treatment is that the rental business has the characteristics of a commercial enterprise"
5323,"No rental ""in your own commercial operation"

5506,III Special conditions for the increased investment allowance for movable assets 1 The 25 percent
5507,increased investment allowance a) Manufacturing industry - except construction industry - aa) Delimitation 191 (1) The delimitation of the construction industry from other manufacturing industries is to be carried out as closely as possible to the systematic directory of economic sectors published by the Federal Statistical Office (BFH rulings of 14 1 1975 - BStBl II p
5508,392 and p
5509,406 and from 8 4 1976 - BStBl II p
5510,410)
5511,The principles of these judgments apply accordingly to the delimitation of the manufacturing industry from the other economic sectors (BFH judgments of 25 6 1976 - BStBl II p
5512,"612, from 10 12 1976 - BStBl II 1977 p"
5513,233 and from 2 5 1980 - BStBl II p
5514,732)
5515,192 (2) A legal claim to the granting of an increased investment allowance cannot be derived from the classification of a company in a trade class of Department 2 of the Systematic Directory of Economic Branches by the State Statistical Office
5516,The final decision as to whether a company can be assigned to the manufacturing industry is made by the tax office
5517,"This applies above all if the classification is in obvious contradiction to the actual conditions of the company or if the company of the beneficiary is undergoing structural change, but also if the trade carried out is not yet listed in the systematic directory"
5518,"193 (3) If a company carries out a mixed activity, the requirement of manufacturing is only fulfilled if the manufacturing activity predominates, taking into account all the establishments belonging to the company (BFH judgment of 23 September 1983 - BStBl II p"
5519,778)
5520,"If the beneficiary only has one permanent establishment in Berlin (West), sentence 1 applies accordingly to the permanent establishment"
5521,"If the business of the beneficiary includes both business premises in Berlin (West) and outside of Berlin (West), sentence 1 shall apply with the proviso that all business premises located in Berlin (West) are to be used; However, it is harmless if the business of the beneficiary does not belong in its entirety to the manufacturing industry (BFH judgment of 10 12 1976 - BStBl II 1977 p"
5522,233)
5523,194 (4) The question of whether the manufacturing activity predominates in a company in which a mixed activity is carried out must be decided according to the circumstances of the individual case
5524,"In this context, the sales, the invested capital, the wages or a combination of all or some of these characteristics can be considered as distinguishing features (BFH judgment of 23 7 1976 - BStBl II p"
5525,705)
5526,"bb) Manufacturing 195 (1) Because of the term ""manufacturing"", reference is made to No."
5527,158 pointed out
5528,Whether an asset is used for production can only be judged on the basis of the function of the respective asset in the company (the permanent establishment)
5529,"196 (2) Since indirect service is sufficient for production, the circle of assets with increased privileges cannot be narrowly drawn"
5530,"Therefore, not only the machinery used for production, but also other movable assets used in the production area, such as"
5531,"Electric carts, forklifts, conveyor belts, lifting platforms, unloading devices, cupboards and shelves for storing the material to be processed, drawing and duplicating devices in the design office, etc."
5532,", but also a drinks machine for the employees working in production, which is mainly used by them (BFH rulings of 27 3 1973 - BStBl II p"
5533,674 and from 11 10 1973 - BStBl II 1974 p
5534,43)
5535,"The production is also used for assets, the acquisition or production costs of which are included as depreciation in the production overheads of the products manufactured by the processing company (BFH judgment of 29 3 1976 - BStBl II p"
5536,409)
5537,"Furthermore, the production of assets that produce goods for immediate delivery to the end user, z"
5538,"a soft ice cream machine in a bakery, a meat grinder in a butcher shop"
5539,Economic goods that are used in administration or management are used for production if the administration or management concerns the production area
5540,"197 (3) Production does not include sales, administration and management, insofar as they serve sales (BFH judgment of 29 3 1976 - BStBl II p"
5541,409)
5542,Economic goods that are used directly or indirectly for distribution are not given higher discounts
5543,"Distribution also includes the packaging of the manufactured goods if it is intended to make the goods more transportable for delivery to the customer or to protect them from damage, soiling, etc."
5544,(Outer packaging)
5545,"The production area, on the other hand, includes the costs of packaging, which is used to make the product salable (inner packaging)"
5546,"Inner packaging is only used if this is necessary from the point of view of the product, e.g."
5547,"Toothpaste in tubes, food in cans, instant coffee in glasses, margarine in cups, bread or sausage slices in plastic film; The packaging machines used for this are still used for production (BFH judgments of 3 3 1978 - BStBl II p"
5548,"412, 413)"
5549,"198 (4) If an asset is used in a manufacturing company (a permanent establishment) not only in the production area but also in other areas of the company, it is only more favorably priced if it is primarily used for production (BFH judgment of 27th 1973 - BStBl II p"
5550,674)
5551,"The same applies if an economic good is used primarily for production as well as other more favored purposes (generation of energy or heat, research or development) (BFH judgment of 17 12 1976 - BStBl II 1977 p"

5555,"Punched tape, magnetic tapes, magnetic cards, floppy disks), and the mere printing of data"
5556,200 (2) The beneficiary assets must be used directly for data processing
5557,Economic goods that are only used indirectly for data processing (e.g.
5558,"Motor vehicles, office equipment, cupboards and shelves for storing magnetic tapes etc."
5559,", Duplicators) are not more favored"
5560,201 (3) Assets that are used directly for data processing in a manufacturing company are more favored regardless of the area in which they are used in such a company
5561,"b) Energy sector 202 (1) The increased investment allowance is also granted for wear-and-tear movable assets that are used directly or indirectly to generate energy or heat or directly for data processing in a company in the energy industry, including district heating plants"
5562,The restriction of the preferential treatment to assets that are used to generate energy or heat corresponds to the limitation of the preferential treatment in manufacturing to assets that are used for production
5563,"According to this, in the energy industry, including district heating plants, the increased investment allowance is only eligible for assets that are used directly for data processing and for generation plants including investments in the high and medium voltage network (electrical energy) or"
5564,"in the high and medium pressure network (gas), but not for investments in the low voltage network, in the low pressure network, in the pipeline network of the district heating plants including the connections of the consumers"
5565,Expenses for investments in the networks are only benefited if they are not related to subsequent production costs (cf.
5566,26) or maintenance costs
5567,"However, the planned expansion of a district heating network planned as a uniform asset is - even if it takes place in stages over several years - to be regarded as the production of a uniform asset"
5568,"203 (2) Because of the term data processing, reference is made to No."
5569,199 pointed out
5570,"Economic goods that are used directly for data processing in a company in the energy industry, including district heating plants, are eligible for increased allowances regardless of whether they are used in the field of energy or heat generation or in other operational areas; Item"
5571,200 applies accordingly
5572,"c) Service trades aa) Delimitation 204 The service trades include commercial enterprises in which the focus of economic activity is not on the execution of deliveries, including works deliveries, but on the execution of other services"
5573,The systematic directory of the economic sectors published by the Federal Statistical Office can be used as an aid to distinguish the service industry from the other economic sectors
5574,"In general, the beneficiaries are the businesses in the branches of the economy listed in sections 5 (transport and communication), 6 (credit institutions and insurance companies) and 7 (services provided by companies and professions)"
5575,"The service industry, however, only includes companies whose activities are aimed at generating income from commercial operations within the meaning of Section 15 EStG"
5576,Businesses in the trade (section 4 of the directory) do not belong to the service industry in this sense
5577,"bb) Data processing 205 For the term data processing and for the delimitation of the beneficiary assets, no"
5578,199 and 200 respectively
5579,"cc) Distance selling orientation 206 (1) For the granting of the increased investment allowance according to § 19 Paragraph 1 Clause 4 No. 1 Letter a, double letter cc BerlinFG, the prerequisite is that the turnover of the business (the permanent establishment) in Berlin (West) is in the calendar year of acquisition or manufacture the beneficiary assets and in the two following calendar years mainly other services to clients outside of Berlin (West)"
5580,If the turnover of the business (the permanent establishment) in Berlin (West) in the calendar year of the acquisition or production of the beneficiary assets does not mainly relate to other services to clients outside of Berlin (West) or if the 50 percent
5581,"- If the limit is not exceeded in one of the two following calendar years, the increased investment allowance is not eligible; this also applies to companies that are newly opened or restructured"
5582,207 (2) Other services to a client outside of Berlin (West) are not already available if the client is domiciled or domiciled outside of Berlin (West)
5583,"Rather, what is required is that the other service is oriented towards distance selling; this is the case if the result of the other service has an economic effect outside of Berlin"
5584,2 Those on 30 or 40 BC
5585,"increased investment allowance 208 (1) Because of the terms research and development, reference is made to No."
5586,118 pointed out
5587,"For the granting of the increased investment allowance according to § 19 Paragraph 1 Clause 4 No. 1 Letter b BerlinFG, it is sufficient if the relevant asset is indirectly used for research or development; Item"
5588,119 applies accordingly
5589,209 (2) The investment allowance is 40 per cent
5590,"the acquisition or production costs of the movable assets acquired or manufactured in the financial year, insofar as the acquisition or production costs do not exceed the amount of 500,000 DM, and 30 per cent"
5591,the acquisition or production costs exceeding this amount (Section 19 (1) sentence 4 no.1 letter b BerlinFG)
5592,"To take into account the limit of DM 500,000 per calendar year when calculating the 40 or 30 percent"

5596,"However, for such intangible assets - even if they serve the beneficiary purposes in a permanent establishment in Berlin (West) - an investment allowance according to § 4 InvZulG (cf."
5597,122 to 132) come into consideration
5598,3 Prerequisites for Remaining and Use 211 (1) The prerequisite for the granting of the increased investment allowance is that the beneficial asset also meets the additional requirements for the increased investment allowance at least three years after its acquisition or manufacture
5599,"If an asset partially fulfills the additional requirements of Section 19 Paragraph 1 Clause 4 No. 1 Letter a and partially those of Section 19 Paragraph 1 Clause 4 No. 1 Letter b BerlinFG within the three-year period, an investment allowance of 25% is required for the asset"
5600,(BFH judgment of 17 December 1976 - BStBl II 1977 p

5606,171)
5607,"The prerequisite for this is that, by the end of the three-year period, a sold asset continues to be in the purchaser's business premises and a rented or leased business good in the business premises of the tenant or lessee fulfills the usage requirements necessary for the increased investment allowance (BFH judgment of 6 5 1977 - BStBl II p"
5608,592)
5609,213 (3) If the actual use of an asset in the relevant three-year period does not correspond to the use assumed in the decision on the application for an investment allowance and an investment allowance that is too high has therefore been granted (e.g.
5610,"the asset should be used in the area of ​​research or development, but in fact it has partly also been used in the production area), the investment allowance is to be reclaimed insofar as only a lower investment allowance can be considered due to the lack of the conditions for use"

5612,IV Special requirements for the 25 percent
5613,increased investment allowance for immovable assets 214 (1) The 25 per cent

5805,416 - recognizable): Section 1 Personal scope of application § 19a EStG applies to employees who are subject to unlimited and limited income tax and who are currently employed
5806,"Therefore, the transfer of asset shares to former employees of the employer is generally not tax-privileged"
5807,There is only an exception if former employees still receive the free or discounted asset participation as wages for their actual work in the course of winding up their previous employment
5808,"Section 2 Definition of asset participations (1) The asset participations, the transfer of which is tax-privileged according to § 19a EStG, are finally listed in § 19a Paragraph 3 in conjunction with Paragraphs 4 to 6 EStG"
5809,"According to this, investments in assets in the employer's company (company investments) as well as investments in assets in other companies (non-company investments) can be granted tax-deductible"
5810,Asset sharing can only be granted tax-privileged if its term does not end before the blocking period
5811,"(2) The following shares can be granted tax-deductible: shares issued by domestic or foreign employers; This also includes shares in a company that is associated with the employer's company as the controlling company (Section 18 (1) AktG), shares in domestic companies, shares in foreign companies that are either admitted to official trading on a German stock exchange or to the regulated market or are included in the regulated Regulated Unofficial Market"
5812,"(3) An income bond is a security that is made out to the bearer, name or to order and in which the payment of a certain sum of money - usually redemption at nominal value - is promised"
5813,"It is irrelevant whether redemption is planned after the deadline, termination or return"
5814,It is also irrelevant whether claims for the value of money are documented in addition to claims for amounts of money; so lies z
5815,"an income bond is also provided if redemption is agreed at the price of a corresponding share, but at least for a certain sum of money"
5816,"The prerequisite in all cases is that, in addition to a certain amount of money, interest is promised that is related to the profit"
5817,The designation as interest does not matter
5818,"In addition to the profit-related interest rate, a fixed interest rate can be promised or paid"
5819,a profit-independent minimum interest rate must be agreed
5820,"In this case, an income bond can only be given tax-deductible if either the declaration required in Section 19a Paragraph 4 No. 1 EStG is available or the conditions required in Section 19a Paragraph 4 No. 2 EStG are met"
5821,"The minimum interest rate within the meaning of Section 19a (4) No. 2 EStG is determined by the issue price, not the nominal value or the current price of the income bond"
5822,(4) Convertible bonds and income bonds that are registered bonds of the employer can only be surrendered with tax relief if the employee's claims from the bond are guaranteed by a domestic credit institution at the employer's expense or are secured under private law by a domestic insurance company; a change of the surety or the insurance company during the blocking period is permitted if the new surety or the new insurance company assumes the obligations that have arisen up to now
5823,The lock-up period is not affected by the occurrence of the security case
5824,Security is not required if the employer is a domestic credit institution
5825,"(5) A profit participation certificate is a security if it certifies a profit participation right and is made out to the holder, name or order"
5826,A participation certificate can in principle be issued by companies of any legal form
5827,"Profit participation rights can be all property rights, as typically due to shareholders"
5828,They differ from membership rights in the lack of control and management rights
5829,A profit participation certificate can only be given tax-privileged if the content of the profit participation right is the right to the profit of a company
5830,The promise of a profit-independent minimum or
5831,Fixed interest is fundamentally not in line with this
5832,"A profit-independent minimum or fixed interest does not exist if the interest payment is dependent on sufficient profit, e.g."
5833,in the event of a share in the loss (see Section 10 (5) of the German Banking Act)
5834,"A profit-independent minimum interest rate is permitted, however, if either the declaration required in Section 19a Paragraph 5 in conjunction with Paragraph 4 No. 1 EStG is available or the conditions required in Section 19a Paragraph 5 in conjunction with Paragraph 4 No. 2 EStG are met"
5835,"The minimum interest rate within the meaning of Section 19a Paragraph 5 in conjunction with Paragraph 4 No. 2 EStG is determined by the issue price, not by the nominal value or the daily rate of the profit participation right"
5836,"Are other rights agreed in addition to the right to profit of a company, which can also be typical property rights of a shareholder (e.g."
5837,"Subscription rights), this does not preclude the acceptance of a profit participation right"
5838,The tax-privileged transfer of a profit participation certificate also requires that repayment at nominal value has not been promised
5839,This requirement is z
5840,"fulfilled in the following cases: Exclusion of repayment (non-cancellability, no withdrawal of the participation certificate); Refundability in the event of termination, return or after expiry of the deadline if the repayment claim is based on the performance of a company (e.g."
5841,"is aimed directly at a share of the liquidation proceeds or is based on the stock exchange price of a corresponding share in the company); Refundability in the event of termination, return or after the deadline if participation in the loss has been agreed; Refundability upon termination, return or after expiry of the deadline, if repayment may only be made from profit"
5842,"If repayment at nominal value has been promised, it can be an income bond (Paragraph 3)"
5843,(6) A business credit with a cooperative can only be transferred if the employee is already a member of the cooperative or is accepted as a member by the cooperative
5844,"This is usually possible with credit unions, consumer unions, or construction and housing cooperatives"
5845,"Post, savings and loan associations are equal to credit unions"
5846,"The free or discounted transfer of business assets at a cooperative to its employees is compatible with Section 22 (4) of the Cooperative Act, if the employee's member contributes to the amount of the monetary benefit from the employer's cooperative"
5847,"(7) A capital contribution or a share in a GmbH can be transferred if the articles of association, membership agreement or assignment agreement is notarized"
5848,"A capital contribution can already be made if the GmbH articles of association have been concluded, but the company has not yet been entered in the commercial register (foundation stage)"
5849,"If the entry is not made, Section 10 Paragraph 2 No. 9 and Section 11 Paragraph 1 No. 3 and Paragraph 3 must be observed"
5850,"(8) A silent partnership can be left to any legal form in a company if the company, e.g."
5851,"because of the type of business conducted or because of its legal form, is considered a trade"
5852,"The distinction between a silent partnership and a profit-sharing loan depends on whether the contractual partners pursue a common purpose (cf. the BFH judgment of June 21, 1983 BStBl II p"
5853,563)
5854,The express agreement of control rights of the employee can be an indication of the pursuit of a common purpose
5855,"If there is no common purpose between the contractual partners, there is a participation loan (Paragraph 9)"
5856,(9) A loan claim against the employer can only be granted tax-privileged if the employee's claims from the loan claim are secured; Paragraph 4 applies accordingly
5857,"Loan claims against the employer also include loan claims against a domestic company which, as the controlling company, is associated with the employer's company (Section 18 (1) AktG)"
5858,"(10) A profit-sharing right in the employer's company, for which no profit-sharing certificate with the character of securities has been issued, can be granted tax-privileged if the conditions of paragraph 5 are met"
5859,"If repayment at nominal value has been agreed, it is a participation loan (see paragraph 9)"
5860,"The profit-sharing rights in the employer's company also include profit-sharing rights in a domestic company which, as the controlling company, is associated with the employer's company (Section 18 (1) AktG)"
5861,Section 3 Provision of property investments (1) Property investments can be made available to employees by the employer himself
5862,It does not matter whether the employer is the legal owner of the asset participation
5863,"Asset sharing is also made available by the employer if the employee has the asset sharing by a representative of the employer, e.g."
5864,a credit institution
5865,"(2) In the context of a current employment relationship, asset shares can also be transferred by a third party"
5866,These include
5867,"the cases in which the asset participations are transferred from a company that is affiliated with the employer's company in a group (Section 18 AktG), a third party for whom the employer reimburses all or part of the expenses incurred by the transfer"
5868,It does not matter whether the employer is involved in the transfer
5869,"Section 4 Value of the asset participation (1) The determination of the value of asset participation within the meaning of Section 19a (3) EStG is based on Section 19a (8) EStG, regardless of whether the tax relief under Section 19a (1) EStG is used"
5870,Disposal bans do not reduce the value
5871,"(2) If employees receive listed asset holdings within the meaning of Section 19a Paragraph 3 No. 1 to 3 EStG no later than 9 months after the date of the resolution on the transfer, they are to be valued at the lowest stock exchange price on the day of the resolution, subject to sentence 4 (Section 19a Para 8 sentence 2 EStG)"
5872,"If a controlling company resolves in the sense of Section 18 (1) AktG to transfer such asset shares to employees of the group, the date of this resolution is decisive for the valuation; this also applies if the dependent company reproduces the transfer decision of the controlling company in its own resolution without acquiring the securities from it"
5873,"If the dependent company acquires the securities, the day on which the resolution is passed is decisive"
5874,"If a listing is not available on the decisive date of the resolution, the asset participations are valued at the last rate listed in official trading within 30 days prior to this day (Section 19a (8) sentence 3 EStG)"
5875,"(3) If employees receive listed asset investments within the meaning of Section 19a Paragraph 3 No. 1 to 3 EStG after 9 months from the date on which the resolution was passed, they are to be valued at the lowest stock exchange price on the day of the provision (Section 19a Para 8 sentence 5 EStG)"
5876,The day of booking out by the person providing the transfer or his / her vicarious agents is deemed to be the day of release
5877,"(4) Investments in assets within the meaning of Section 19a Paragraph 3 No. 1 to 3 EStG, for which a price has not been determined on the date of the resolution and within thirty days before the date of the resolution, neither in the official market nor in the regulated market nor in the regulated unofficial market to apply the fair value on the day of the transfer; If a price is determined on this day, this is the common value"
5878,"For reasons of simplicity, the value of new shares that have not yet been listed on the stock exchange but are already fully entitled to dividends can be derived from the price of the old shares on the day of the resolution"
5879,"In the case of new shares that have not yet been listed on the stock exchange and are not yet fully entitled to dividends, a total discount of 10 per cent"
5880,"of the stock exchange price of the old shares, no more than 30%"
5881,be made from the nominal value of the share
5882,The calculated value applies to all new shares that are made available to the employee within nine months of the decision date
5883,"After 9 months, the price of the old shares on the day of transfer is to be used"
5884,"For the evaluation within a group, paragraph 2 sentences 2 and 3 are to be applied"
5885,"(5) Whether non-securitized participations in assets within the meaning of Section 19a Paragraph 3 Nos 7 9 10 and 11 EStG are to be assessed at a higher or lower value than the nominal value due to special circumstances (Section 19a Paragraph 8 Sentence 7 EStG), depends on the principles of the sections 55 and 56 VStR to decide"
5886,Then z
5887,"In the case of a loan claim within the meaning of Section 19a Paragraph 3 No. 10 EStG, the valuation below the nominal value is usually justified if the claim is interest-free (Section 55 Paragraph 2 No. 1 VStR)"
5888,"On the other hand, z"
5889,"In the case of such a loan claim against the employer that is justified for the employee, the valuation of the nominal value is generally justified if the claim is subject to high interest and cannot be terminated by the debtor (employer) for a longer period of time (Section 55 (3) VStR)"
5890,"An agreement according to which the employer cannot terminate the loan claim until the expiry of the six-year blocking period is possible, but is not stipulated as a prerequisite for tax relief under Section 19a (1) sentence 2 EStG"
5891,"Section 19a (1) sentence 2 EStG only requires a contractual obligation on the part of the employee (creditor) not to dispose of the claim for his part during the blocking period, unless circumstances arise in his person that allow his early disposal according to Section 19a (2) sentence 5 EStG"
5892,The debtor cannot terminate the loan for a longer period within the meaning of Section 55 (3) VStR if it has also been clearly agreed that the employer may not terminate the loan claim during the six-year blocking period; this does not result from an agreement corresponding to the wording of Section 19a (1) sentence 2 EStG
5893,"(6) The average value of capital contributions or shares in a GmbH, for which no separate determination has been made (see § 3 AntbewVO), is to be determined by a fictitious share valuation according to the principles of § 11 Paragraph 2 BewG"
5894,The determination is made by the tax office responsible for the GmbH
5895,"Capital contributions or shares in a GmbH, which did not exist at the beginning of the calendar year, are generally to be valued with the paid-in capital"
5896,In companies that z
5897,"have arisen through conversion from a partnership or a sole proprietorship or within the scope of a business split from an existing company, however, the determination of the common value must be carried out by the company tax office of the GmbH according to the principles of sections 77 to 79 VStR"
5898,"The income percentage can be derived from the previous operating results of the partnership or sole proprietorship, whereby the effects of the changed legal form may be"
5899,must be taken into account by making corrections to the operating results
5900,"(7) If a stock corporation or a partnership limited by shares grants its employees its own shares on the basis of a resolution that was passed before January 1, 1987, these shares are then also valued at the lowest stock market price on the day the resolution was passed. if the shares are transferred after December 31, 1986; the nine-month period does not apply (Section 52 (19a) EStG)"
5901,Treasury shares are only those that certify membership rights in the employer's company
5902,Therefore it is z
5903,"in the case of shares of a group parent company, not own shares of the group subsidiary (BFH judgment of 11 July 1986 BStBl 1987 II p"
5904,"300) with the result that if such shares are made available to employees of the group subsidiary, the stock exchange price on the day of the resolution passed before 1987 is not decisive"
5905,Treasury shares are also not considered if employees directly acquire new shares in the course of a capital increase that were not previously owned by the corporation
5906,"If the corporation is the owner of the new shares, they are to be valued at the stock exchange price on the decision date prior to 1987 when they are transferred to the employees if there was a stock exchange price for the new shares on that day"
5907,"If a stock exchange price was not available on the day of the resolution or within thirty days prior to this day, the market price on the day of the transfer is decisive; the simplification regulation of paragraph 4 sentence 2 does not apply"
5908,Section 5 Determination of the tax-free pecuniary benefit (1) The pecuniary benefit results from the difference between the value of the asset participation (see Section 4) and the price at which the asset participation is left to the employee
5909,"The tax exemption of the pecuniary benefit is double limited, namely to half the value of the asset participation, but at most to 500 DM annually (Section 19a (1) sentence 1 EStG)"
5910,From this it follows that the pecuniary benefit is only part of the taxable wages insofar as it exceeds half the value of the property participation
5911,"If the monetary benefit is higher than 500 DM in the calendar year, the part of the monetary benefit exceeding 500 DM is part of the taxable wages even if half of the value of the asset participation is not exceeded"
5912,Examples: Personal contribution of the employeeValue of the participationTax-freeTaxableWith free leasing-1005050-1000500500-1200500700With discounted leasing400800400-1005002501505001000500-550110050050 (2) The maximum tax-free amount is based on the employment relationship
5913,Employees who are employed consecutively or next to one another in several employment relationships in a calendar year can therefore claim the tax-free maximum amount several times
5914,(3) If the employer bears the ancillary costs for establishing or acquiring equity interests (e.g.
5915,"Custody fees, stock exchange sales tax, notary fees, entry fees in connection with business credits at a cooperative and costs for entries in the register), the assumption of these costs is not wages"
5916,Section 6 Conversion of wages The granting of an asset participation is not free of charge or at a reduced price if the asset participation takes the place of the wages owed in whole or in part
5917,Section 7 Acquisition of tax-privileged investments in assets with capital-forming benefits The purchase price of reduced-priced assets can also be paid by the employee with capital-building benefits within the meaning of 5 VermBG
5918,The prerequisite for this is that the provisions of 5 VermBG are observed
5919,"In particular, the freedom of choice prescribed in § 12 5 VermBG must be available"
5920,This is not the case if the employer only allows capital-forming benefits to be invested in the form of asset participation
5921,Section 8 Determination of Securities (1) Securities within the meaning of Section 19a Paragraph 3 No. 1 to 6 EStG are to be determined by the fact that they are kept in safe custody with the employer or with a bank in special or collective custody
5922,"(2) The safekeeping must be identified as follows: If the securities are kept in safekeeping by the employer, the safekeeping and the blocking period must be recorded in the payroll account (see Section 9, Paragraph 1)"
5923,"If the securities are held in custody by a bank, a blocking note must be made in the custody books"
5924,"In the case of third-party custody or collective custody, a blocking note in the customer account with the first custodian bank is sufficient"
5925,"(3) In the case of custody by a credit institution, the employee must submit a safekeeping certificate (Section 9 Paragraph 3) to the employer within three months of the acquisition of the securities in the cases of Section 3 Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 Clause 2"
5926,"Violation of the submission deadline leads to subsequent taxation of the tax-free pecuniary benefit (see Section 10, Paragraph 1, Sentence 2)"
5927,(4) A change of custodian within the blocking period is permitted
5928,Paragraph 3 applies accordingly
5929,"Section 9 Obligations to record and provide certification (1) In the cases of Section 3 Paragraph 1 and Paragraph 2 Clause 2, the employer must note the tax-privileged transfer of asset shares in the employee's payroll account, in a collective wage account or in other records and thereby note the amount of the tax-free record any monetary benefit left as well as the beginning and end of the blocking period"
5930,"If securities within the meaning of Section 19a Paragraph 3 No. 1 to 3 EStG are transferred, the day on which the resolution on the transfer and the day of the transfer are also recorded"
5931,"(2) If securities are kept in safe custody by the employer, it must be evident from the list above that they are kept in safe custody for the six-year blocking period"
5932,(3) The bank that takes securities into custody in accordance with Section 8 Paragraph 2 No. 2 must certify this to the employee (safe custody certificate)
5933,Section 10 Disposals during the lock-up period (1) A disposal of assets within the meaning of Section 19a (3) EStG and the repeal of the determination of securities within the meaning of Section 19a (3) No. 1 to 6 EStG during the lock-up period leads to subsequent taxation of the tax-free pecuniary benefit
5934,"The same applies if the submission deadline in Section 8 Paragraph 3 (2) is not met if the employee or his or her spouse who is not permanently separated has died after receiving the share in the property or if one of them has a degree of disability greater than or equal to when 90 occurred; the employee got married after receiving the asset participation, but before the early disposal or the early cancellation of the determination and at the time of the early disposal or the early cancellation of the determination at least two years have passed since the start of the blocking period; the employee has become unemployed after receiving the asset participation and the unemployment (cf. section 44 para 4 no 3 LStR) has existed for at least one year without interruption and still exists at the time of the early disposal or the early cancellation of the determination; the employee is a citizen of Yugoslavia, the Republic of Korea, Morocco, Tunisia or Turkey and the Federal Republic of Germany incl"
5935,"Has left Berlin (West) permanently after receiving the asset participation; the employee's employment relationship has been terminated after receiving the asset participation and he has taken up self-employment; the purchase price of securities lent at a reduced price has been paid in full or in part with capital-forming payments that have been invested in a savings contract for securities or other asset investments (Section 5 (1) 5 VermBG), and against the securities before the expiry of the blocking period pursuant to Section 19a (1) EStG other securities within the meaning of Section 19a Paragraph 3 No. 1 to 6 EStG are exchanged"
5936,This exchange is only possible if the securities are kept at the bank
5937,The proceeds from the sale including any price gains are to be used until the end of the following calendar month to acquire the other securities to be determined for the remainder of the blocking period
5938,Remaining amounts do not result in subsequent taxation if they do not exceed DM 300; Amounts remaining from several sales transactions are to be added together; the employee accepts an exchange or compensation offer from a securities issuer during the blocking period; Securities are presented to the issuer for redemption after the draw or termination by the issuer before the expiry of the blocking period; the asset participation has become worthless without the involvement of the employee and therefore the blocking period is not observed
5939,Worthlessness within the meaning of Section 19a (2) sentence 4 EStG is to be assumed if the employee does not exceed 10 percent
5940,the value of the asset participation that was used to determine the pecuniary benefit
5941,If the amounts repaid exceed the 10-percent
5942,"Limit, the subsequent taxation is only omitted if the employee sets the amounts received or other investments in assets acquired with a bank for the remainder of the blocking period"
5943,"Section 11 Obligations to notify (1) The employer must notify the employee's tax office within one month that the employee has not submitted the safekeeping certificate (Section 8, Paragraph 3) or that the employee has sold securities or taken them out of custody within the blocking period"
5944,"The notification can be omitted if the custodian can be proven by a certificate that the securities have been placed in safekeeping again in compliance with Section 8 Paragraphs 1 and 2, or the employee about non-securitized asset participations within the meaning of Section 19a Paragraph 3 No. 7 to 11 EStG has decreed before the expiry of the blocking period through sale, repayment, assignment or loan"
5945,The report is to be made regardless of whether there is a harmless disposition; this is only checked by the tax office
5946,(2) The credit institution that holds securities in accordance with Section 8 Paragraph 1 No. 2 must notify the employee's tax office of residence within one month that the employee has sold the securities or taken them out of custody within the blocking period; Paragraph 1 No. 2 last sentence applies accordingly

5972,", is to be applied accordingly when examining the VE limits of Section 13a Paragraph 1 No. 3 EStG Section 124a EStR"
5973,The prerequisite for the elimination of the determination of the average rate of profit is that the number of VE sustainably exceeds the limits of Section 13a (1) No. 3 EStG
5974,"For the term sustainability, reference is made to Section 135 (4) EStR"
5975,"In the case of a gradual increase in the number of animals, it therefore depends on whether the number of animals converted into VE has been above the limits of Section 13a (1) No. 3 EStG over the three preceding financial years"
5976,"If this is the case, the requirements of Section 13a (1) No. 3 EStG are no longer met from the beginning of the fourth financial year"

5983,The value of the work performed by the business owner and his relatives who are not employed in the company on the basis of an employment relationship to be determined in accordance with Section 13a (5) EStG must therefore be added to the basic amount (Section 13A (3) No. 2 EStG)
5984,"Sect. 130 a para. 4 to 6 of the EStR must be observed in this regard: In detail, the following is pointed out: When determining the value of the work for the physical work of the owner and the relatives who are not employed, only the work that is to be taken into account is the result the areas recorded in the initial value in accordance with Section 13a (4) EStG in individual cases are omitted"

6287,The possibility of offsetting losses from foreign permanent establishments previously contained in Section 2 AIG is retained through adoption in Section 2a Paragraph 3 and 4 EStG
6288,3 Tax-free income The tax exemption for service and prospective salaries that are paid as maternity allowance for the period of maternity leave (§ 3 No. 1 letter d EStG) is deleted
6289,"From VZ 1990, the tax exemption according to § 3 No. 11 EStG is made dependent on the fact that the recipient is not obliged to provide a certain economic or artistic consideration or to an employee activity with the payments (so far § 3 No. 44 letter b EStG)"
6290,The amendment to Section 3 No. 13 EStG creates an express legal basis for the tax exemption of the separation allowances that have already been treated as tax-free
6291,The tax exemption of marriage and childbirth grants according to Section 3 No. 15 EStG is now set at DM 700
6292,Section 3 No. 16 EStG now finally regulates which income-related expenses the employer can reimburse the employee outside the public service without tax
6293,The reimbursement of other income-related expenses by the employer is no longer tax-free in future
6294,The compensation that was previously exempt from tax under the Federal Disease Act for reasons of equity is now expressly exempt from tax under Section 3 No. 25 EStG
6295,The so-called
6296,"Tip exemption (§ 3 No. 51 EStG), is increased from 1200 to 2400 DM"
6297,"The provision of Section 3 No. 63 EStG, which was changed with effect from VZ 1989, is intended to ensure that certain income in Germany only remains tax-free if it is actually used in the GDR for income tax or a tax equivalent to income tax"
6298,"The tax exemption according to § 3 No. 68 EStG for certain interest savings and interest subsidies by the employer is abolished from 1989; Interest savings and interest subsidies from loans received before 1989 remain tax-free for a further 12 years up to the calendar year 2000 (see Section 52 (2c) EStG), but only if the benefits do not exceed those granted in the calendar year 1988"
6299,"4 Tax exemption for certain wage supplements From 1990 onwards, with regard to the extent of the tax exemption for wage supplements, there is no longer any distinction between whether and to what extent wage supplements are regulated by law or stipulated in collective agreements or not"
6300,Section 3b EStG therefore provides for a uniform tax treatment of wage supplements
6301,Paragraph 3 contains a special regulation for those employees who spend more than 50 percent of the time in the wage payment period
6302,Do night work and have started night work before 000 o'clock

6317,"Regarding the deductibility of the other interest on tax claims, reference is made to the statements on Section 10 (1) No. 5 and Section 12 (3) EStG and the amendments to the Corporate Income Tax Act (to Section 10 No. 2 KStG)"

6324,z EStG)
6325,This valuation method assumes that the most recently purchased or manufactured assets are first resold or consumed (last in-first out)
6326,"The prerequisite is that the goods are of the same type, the commercial law principles of proper bookkeeping are not violated, the trade balance is proceeded accordingly and the discounted import goods discount is not used"
6327,A change to another valuation method is only possible with the consent of the tax office
6328,"As a result of the general introduction of the Lifo valuation of inventories for fiscal years ending in the assessment period 1990, the previously existing special regulation, which provided for the Lifo method for certain precious metals and copper, can be lifted from this point in time"
6329,"Due to the limitation of the price increase reserve and the halving of the import goods discount, reference is made to the statements on Section 51 (1) No. 2 EStG"

6531,exist for previously taxable income from insurance policies with a term of less than twelve years
6532,"Insurance for which a term of at least twelve years was agreed, but which, due to early surrender, only reaches a term of less than twelve years, is treated like insurance for which a term of less than twelve years was intended from the outset"
6533,"In these cases, however, in order to postpone taxation of the 10% tax"
6534,"In order to avoid taxed income, insurance policies with a term of less than twelve years still apply a tax deduction of just 10% from the outset"
6535,", so that at the end of such a contract a possible final profit share and the accounting interest add to the capital gains tax deduction of 25%"

6545,"In the case of income from securitized capital claims, the Federal Office of Finance reimburses the capital gains tax withheld and paid by the issuer in accordance with Section 44b (1) EStG"
6546,f) Exclusion of the reimbursement of capital gains tax The buyer of dividend or interest coupons will not be reimbursed the capital gains tax retained by the issuer because he is not a creditor of the capital income in relation to the issuer (Section 45 EStG)
6547,This is because the credit or reimbursement of capital gains tax is only possible for the shareholder or holder of the bond

6549,Since with the tax deduction of 10%
6550,"the income tax is generally settled on income from life insurance, the insurance companies only have to issue a certificate of withheld and paid capital gains tax at the request of the policyholder, e.g."
6551,because the policyholder wants to include the income in the income tax assessment (Section 45b sentence 4 EStG)
6552,"h) Special treatment of investment income from life insurances The new § 45b EStG basically stipulates the compensation for income from life insurance which, according to § 43a EStG, the tax deduction of 10 percent"

6569,"So that those liable to limited income tax - subject to a partial or full refund of the capital gains tax levied on the basis of an agreement to avoid double taxation - can also be covered by the new capital gains tax, the scope of domestic income has been expanded in the sense of the limited income tax liability"

6754,"The interest ends when the additional tax claim or tax refund is due for the first time, but at the latest after 4 years"
6755,The limitation to 4 years takes account of the fact that external audits are often only carried out a long time after the end of the individual tax year for reasons for which the taxpayers are not responsible
6756,"Due to the time limitation of the interest run, the taxpayers are set up for the interest payment as if the tax assessment was carried out promptly on the basis of the external audit"

6763,"The general interest rate applies for the first time to claims that arise after December 31, 1988 (see Article 16 No. 2 of the Tax Reform Act 1990)"

6768,4 Evasion interest and litigation interest The changes to §§ 235 236 AO are related to the introduction of interest on back tax claims and tax refunds according to § 233a AO

6781,"2 Prerequisites for impunity Anyone who has not or not fully declared his income from capital assets should remain exempt from punishment for periods further back if he correctly and completely declares the capital income for the assessment periods 1986 and 1987 by December 31, 1990, or fails to do so for the assessment periods from 1986 onwards or catches up or corrects incorrect information"
6782,"The effects of the declarations exempting from punishment also extend to cases in which, under the impression of the public discussion about the tax liability of interest income, when the income from capital assets is disclosed, declarations have been made after October 13, 1987 that meet the requirements of a Exempting declarations are sufficient, in particular voluntary disclosures (§§ 371 378 Paragraph 3 AO), tax returns for assessment periods from 1986, correction declarations (§ 153 AO) or anticipated ""declarations exempting from punishment"""
6783,It would appear unreasonable to withhold the benefit of § 1 and § 2 of the law from this group of people just because the declaration was made prematurely
6784,"In order not to obstruct the path to tax honesty for those who have not indicated the wealth leading to the income in addition to the income from capital assets, the law grants exemption from punishment for the past, also with regard to wealth tax, if the capital assets from which the income flowed are explained"
6785,"In order to avoid tensions within the family, the impunity also extends to persons assessed together with the declaring person who have not themselves declared the capital income or capital assets exempt from punishment"
6786,The same applies in the case of a declaration of exemption from punishment by a child who is now of legal age in favor of former legal representatives
6787,"The regulation does not apply to income from other types of income, even if it is income from assets, or to other types of assets"
6788,"In this respect, impunity can only be obtained under the conditions of Section 371 AO or Section 378 Paragraph 3 AO (voluntary disclosure)"
6789,Further prerequisites for exemption from punishment are that the reduced taxes on capital income or capital assets for the assessment periods from 1986 onwards are paid within a reasonable period set by the tax authorities
6790,"A declaration exempting from punishment is no longer possible if an official of the tax authorities has appeared to examine income or wealth tax, or in general to determine a tax offense or tax offense, if the perpetrator or his representative has initiated criminal or fine proceedings because of an income or tax offense Property tax evasion has been announced, or the offense has already been wholly or partly discovered at the time of the declaration exempting the offense and the perpetrator knew this or, given a reasonable assessment of the situation, had to expect it"
6791,"In the case of a frivolous reduction in taxes, the same conditions apply to failure to investigate as to exemption from punishment in the case of willful tax evasion"
6792,"3 Consequences under tax law of a declaration exempting from penalties In order to make it easier for taxpayers who have not or not fully disclosed their income from capital assets and the corresponding capital assets in the past, the way to tax compliance, the law provides in addition to the exemption from penalties or fines, that there is no subsequent taxation for the period prior to 1986 if there is no impunity or a fine is not imposed"
6793,"This also applies if the taxpayer has not acted at fault with regard to a tax reduction, e.g."
6794,found in an unavoidable error of prohibition
6795,The law ensures that tax assessment is not excluded in those cases in which an inheritance for tax debts of a testator who himself has not made a subsequent declaration exempting the penalty can be claimed
6796,"In these cases, the tax situation is regularly reported by e.g."
6797,discovered by credit institutions according to Section 33 of the Inheritance Tax Act
6798,"If a declaration exempting the tax within the meaning of Section 1 of the Act has not yet been submitted when submitting a tax return, the taxpayer should still have the opportunity to be tax-compliant"
6799,The tax authority must therefore set a reasonable deadline for any declaration exempting from punishment

6913,"In addition, the specified information about the apartments must also be provided if one takes the view that with Annex W only information may be requested that is relevant for the taxation of the assessment period 1986"
6914,"In conclusion, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that it is in the best interests of the taxpayer to fill out Annex W, since the tax-free withdrawal of apartments regulated in Section 52 (15) and 21 EStG is a tax advantage for which the taxpayer in the case of Unclearness about the existence of the legal requirements bears the burden of determination """

6922,"The tables created on the basis of the calculation take into account five different values ​​for differentiation: the living area, the co-ownership share, the size of the property, the year of construction, the land value"
6923,The information on 1 and 2 can be found in the tax files or by contacting the taxpayer
6924,The information on 3 to 5 will in future be noted by the valuation and property tax offices on the back of the copy of the sale notification intended for the purchaser's tax office
6925,"If information is exceptionally missing, this can be requested by telephone or in writing from the valuation and property tax office responsible for the standard valuation of the condominium"
6926,These values ​​can be given to the taxpayer or
6927,his advisor can be informed upon request before the assessment is carried out
6928,"After all the initial data are available, proceed as follows: The property size specified in square meters must be multiplied by the value of the co-ownership share in order to determine the size of the proportional property area corresponding to the co-ownership"
6929,Example: Total size of the property: 1200 sqm Co-ownership: 70/1000 Proportional property area: 1200 x 70: 1000 = 84 sqm The ratio of this proportionate property area to the living space must be calculated
6930,Example: Proportional property area: 84 sqm living area: 110 sqm living area: proportionate GrSt
6931,area = 110: 84 = 131 result = 1: 131 This means that in this case table no 10 is to be used
6932,The building age (age) is to be determined
6933,The year of completion of the building (year of construction) must be deducted from the year of acquisition
6934,"Example: Year of purchase: 1986 Year of construction: 1934 Age: 1986 - 1934 = 52 years In the table under ""Age in years"" this value is to be found"
6935,It can be found at 50 - 54 years of age
6936,"In the column 50 - 54 years of age, look for the value that is assigned to the land price reported by the valuation and property tax office"
6937,Example: Land price: 650 DM / sqm The corresponding table value can now be read off
6938,"For a land price of DM 600 to DM 699, table no. 10 shows a building value share of 84% for ages 50 - 54"
6939,The proportional value for the land is 16%
6940,The use of a tabular value and the underlying output data must be explained in an annex to the tax assessment
6941,"The values ​​in the table only apply to condominiums occupied in Berlin for transfers of ownership (transfer of charges) from January 1, 1984. If the taxpayer does not agree with the share of the value of the building determined in this way, or if an earlier date of purchase is to be taken into account, the valuation and property tax office of the tax office responsible for the unit valuation is to be taken into account to ask for administrative assistance"
6942,This will then carry out a calculation according to the previous procedure (see Circular Order No. 118/85 EW No. 225 (1964)
6943,Administrative assistance should also be requested if the ratio of the proportionate property area is less than 1: 025 or
6944,is greater than 1:45 or if peculiarities of the case are recognizable which suggest that the building value share cannot be recorded in a standard calculation method (e.g.
6945,"In addition to special and co-ownership, there is also a large degree of partial ownership or it is a question of subsequently created attic apartments)"
6946,This circular is to be applied to all non-final assessment cases from the assessment period 1984 onwards
6947,"Insofar as the taxpayer is already aware of the individual value determinations as the basis for depreciation calculations, the determined values ​​will also remain in the future, unless the taxpayer requests the use of the tabular value"
6948,"Addition for the valuation and property control centers: From now on, the following information must be given on the back of the sale notification (GrEStG 1e) intended for condominiums for owner-occupied apartments: Property size (total property size) Year of construction Land value (last guideline value in DM / sqm) requests for official assistance from FÄ in the rest of Germany are still to be answered by the assessment and property control offices"

6960,"In the assessment period 1987, the increased deductions according to Section 7b of the Income Tax Act can be fully taken into account as income-related expenses for rental income"
6961,"This also applies to the pro rata deduction for the period from June 1, 1987, because the deduction for income-related expenses in this case supersedes the deduction of the § 7b amount such as special expenses"
6962,"From the assessment period 1988 onwards, the amounts corresponding to the increased deductions can be paid in full like special expenses according to § 52 Paragraph 21 S."

6968,"The taxpayer used the main apartment for his own residential purposes, the second apartment was rented out"
6969,The taxpayer intends to apply for the abolition of the value-in-use taxation for the owner-occupied apartment from the assessment period 1987 and at the same time to switch to the increased deductions according to § 7b EStG in order to - if they apply to the own apartment - according to § 52 paragraph 21 sentence 4 EStG to be able to deduct such special expenses for the remaining benefit period
6970,"Solution: According to section 53, paragraph 8 p"
6971,3 and 4 EStR 1987 is the transition from the degressive depreciation according to § 7 Abs 5 EStG to the increased deductions according to § 7b EStG or

6975,The provision of Section 52 Paragraph 21 S
6976,4 EStG does not require that the transfer take place at the latest for the 1986 assessment period
6977,The amounts corresponding to the increased deductions according to § 7b EStG can therefore also be deducted as special expenses in the assessment period 1987 if the taxpayer first claims the increased deductions in the income tax return for 1987
6978,"III Situation: Half of the spouses were co-owners of a single-family house they used themselves, for which they claimed increased deductions in accordance with Section 7b of the Income Tax Act in 1986 and the corresponding amounts in 1987, such as special expenses in accordance with Section 52, Subsection 21, Clause 4 of the Income Tax Act"
6979,"After a permanent separation in March 1988 and due to an intended divorce, the wife transferred her share of the property to the husband in September 1988, who now continues to live in the house as sole owner"
6980,The question to be decided is to what extent the husband can continue the increased deductions until the end of the beneficiary period such as special expenses
6981,Solution: The taxpayer who met the requirements for the use of increased deductions in the assessment period 1986 can pay the amounts corresponding to the increased deductions under the additional requirements of Section 52 (21) sentence 4 EStG within the framework of the so-called
6982,Deduct small transitional arrangements such as special expenses
6983,"From the fact that the increased deductions according to § 7b EStG in the value-in-use taxation for 1986 were proportionally attributable to each spouse in accordance with his co-ownership, it could be concluded that after the elimination of the value-in-use taxation for the individual spouse, the special expenditure deduction according to § 52 paragraph 21 sentence 4 EStG can be considered"
6984,"The regulation in Section 62, Paragraph 4, Clause 2 of the 1987 Income Tax Regulations would be irrelevant for the case presented"
6985,"According to this regulation, when the spouses' shares are combined into sole ownership of one spouse, the accepting spouse - in the absence of additional acquisition of an independent property - can continue to claim the increased deductions in the amount in which they were previously granted to the spouses jointly, provided that one spouse has his share of ownership transferred to the other spouse at the latest in the assessment period in which the requirements of Section 26 (1) EStG still existed"
6986,"The legislative will to receive the tax relief for the apartment used for their own residential purposes in the same amount as before, even after the expiry of the value-in-use taxation, makes it appear justifiable to proceed accordingly within the framework of the transitional regulation according to Section 52 (21) sentence 4 EStG, d"

7750,The following methods are particularly suitable: offsetting the foreign tax against the German tax that is attributable to the foreign income; u

7752,the removal of foreign income from the German tax base with progression reservation (Section 32b (1) No. 2 EStG) - exemption method

7754,21) is to be used if a DBA does not exist (see no
7755,"41), exists for the income for which the DTA provides for crediting (cf."
7756,331)
7757,The exemption method (cf.
7758,22) is only to be used insofar as this is provided for in a DTA (cf.
7759,341)
7760,There is no offsetting of foreign taxes or a deduction from the total amount of income
7761,"An overview of the tax exemption and tax reductions for foreign income is contained in Annex 221 Credit method. With the credit method, the Federal Republic of Germany has the full right to tax foreign income"
7762,"This applies to both positive and negative income, i.e."
7763,the latter are to be allowed to compensate for other income

7777,3 Foreign income from a country with which a DTA exists31 General information on DTAs311 Existing DTAs An overview of the current status of DTAs and DTA negotiations is published in BStBl Part I at the beginning of each year
7778,The overview of the DTAs as of 1 1 1990 contains the Annex 4312 Structure of the DTA Most DTAs are structured as follows: The introductory provisions delimit the scope of the agreement and contain the definitions that are important for its application (e.g.
7779,"Residence, permanent establishment)"
7780,The following articles set the framework within which the source state may tax income
7781,Another article determines how the state of residence avoids double taxation of income that is left to the source state for taxation
7782,"The final articles regulate the protection against tax discrimination, the implementation of mutual agreement procedures, the exchange of information between the contracting states as well as the entry into force and expiry of the agreement"
7783,"It should be noted that individual DBA provisions in additional agreements (final protocol, etc."
7784,) can be modified or explained
7785,313 Taxation rules of the DBA The rules on taxation in the source country generally do not allow any conclusions to be drawn about taxation in the country of residence; this can be found regularly in the article on avoiding double taxation in the country of residence (cf.
7786,also No.
7787,"Insofar as ""can"" and / or ""may"" are mentioned in the regulation of taxation law in a DTA, the respective regulation only refers to the specifically addressed contracting state"
7788,"If the latter does not make use of the permit, i.e. does not exercise his right to tax, the other contracting state generally has no right to tax"
7789,The other contracting state is therefore also limited in this case to the right to tax that the DTA expressly leaves it (prohibition of virtual double taxation)
7790,32 Residency Unlimited Stpfl are also i
7791,of the respective double taxation agreement resident in the Federal Republic of Germany

7794,of the agreement applies
7795,"As a rule, this is the state with which the Stpfl has closer personal and economic relationships (center of life interests)"
7796,Special feature: According to the DBA USA 1966 (Art
7797,XV Paragraph 1 No. 2) American citizenship already leads to dual residence
7798,"If the Federal Republic of Germany is not the country of residence in the case of dual residence, there is usually no right to tax foreign income in Germany"
7799,These are also not subject to the progression proviso
7800,The personal unlimited tax liability in Germany remains unaffected
7801,"Residency abroad is only assumed for the application of the DBA (cf. AO application decree on § 8 No. 2 AO card index, § 8 card 1)"
7802,"If the Federal Republic of Germany is the state of residence or if it is considered as such in the case of dual residence, it must first be determined in accordance with the articles on taxation in the source state whether the foreign state has a right to tax"
7803,"If the foreign state has no right to tax, the income must be recorded in the Federal Republic of Germany"
7804,It must be ensured that the foreign income is also included in the respective annexes to the income tax return and is transferred to the designated Kz
7805,14 must be observed
7806,Crediting or deduction of foreign taxes is ruled out

7808,No statement has yet been made on how double taxation will be avoided in the Federal Republic of Germany (cf.
7809,313)
7810,The avoidance of double taxation in the country of residence is regulated in a separate article of the agreement
7811,The DTAs use two methods: the credit method and the exemption method (cf.
7812,21 and 22)
7813,33 Crediting of foreign taxes (crediting method) 331 General The crediting method (cf.
7814,21) applies according to the DBA i
7815,"In the case of income from dividends, interest and license fees (if there is a withholding tax right), from artists and professional athletes, from supervisory boards, from immovable property in exceptional cases (e.g."
7816,"Switzerland, Spain)"
7817,Income is included in Germany when determining the total amount of income; Section 2a (1) and (2) EStG must be observed (cf.
7818,21 511 and 514)
7819,332 Implementation of the crediting The pro rata German income tax applicable to the foreign income is to be determined in total for the income originating from one state
7820,"The calculation of the maximum amount in accordance with Section 34c (1) EStG is based on the foreign income that is taken into account when determining the taxable income, i.e."
7821,after application of § 2a Abs 1 EStG
7822,The foreign taxes to be offset are also to be included in the foreign taxes that have been paid on income within the meaning of Section 2a (1) EStG
7823,"As a result, in cases in which, on the basis of Section 2a (1) EStG, total income from a state is not to be taken into account when determining the total amount of income (e.g."
7824,"Losses from silent participation), which may be applied to foreign income"
7825,foreign taxes levied within the framework of the maximum amount according to § 34c paragraph 1 EStG or deducted at the request of the Stpfl according to § 34c paragraph 2 EStG when determining the total amount of income (cf. section 212c sentence 4 and 212d paragraph 2 EStR)
7826,The right to choose must be exercised uniformly for all income from a foreign country and for all taxes that can be offset under the respective double taxation agreement (cf. section 212 e sentence 4 EStR)
7827,"In the case of a deduction according to Section 34c (2) EStG, the number of the state for which the deduction was requested must be entered in the ESt / LSt 1 A cover sheet at Kz 1884"
7828,The application of Section 34c (3) EStG is out of the question here

7838,Individual agreements grant tax exemption for permanent establishment profits only if the income of the permanent establishment comes from certain (active) activities
7839,342 Progression reservation The progression reservation according to § 32b EStG does not apply to income from Italy as long as the DBA Italy 1925 is still applicable
7840,"The type and amount of foreign income must also be determined for the purpose of the progression proviso under German tax law (see Section 185, Paragraph 1 of the Income Tax Law)"
7841,Operating expenses and advertising expenses (also possibly

7899,"If the Stpfl has several commercial establishments in the foreign country concerned (participation in a co-entrepreneurship also counts as a permanent establishment), a loss can only be deducted if a loss still remains after offsetting with profits from the same country"
7900,522 Application The application must be submitted to the local tax office (e.g.
7901,by entering the loss in the GSE attachment to code 2138)
7902,A notification from the permanent establishment tax office that a foreign loss can be taken into account according to § 2 AIG does not in itself contain an application (cf. in detail no

7925,That applies u
7926,if a domestic partnership generates such income or if several tax residents are involved in foreign partnerships
7927,"In the latter case, the participation must be reported to the Federal Office of Finance using form BfF 2"

7934,The application of Section 2 Paragraph 1 AIG (from 1990: Section 2a Paragraph 3 EStG) is only to be decided when assessing the income tax of the individual participants (see BFH of 28 4 1983 BStBl 1983 II p

7937,In the determination procedure it is only necessary to decide whether and to what extent the permanent establishment income meets the requirements of Section 2 Paragraph 1 and Section 5 AIG (from 1990: Section 2a Paragraph 3 in conjunction with
7938,Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Income Tax Act) and from which country this income comes

8344,The following must also be observed: 81 Determination of the business tax deductible as business expenses from the tax rate for income / surplus calculation Only the portion of business tax that is included in the tax rate may be used as business expense
8345,"Even if the Stpfl's calculations result in a higher trade tax than is included in the tax rate paid, the trade tax is only deemed to have been paid first in the amount actually paid"
8346,"When the trade tax liability began in the 2nd half of 1990, withholding tax payments were not increased because other parts of the tax rate were no longer applicable in the 2nd half of 1990 (e.g."
8347,"Production fund tax, payroll tax), the trade tax in the amount of these omitted taxes is deemed to have been paid"
8348,"If the trade tax component in the tax rate was higher than the calculated trade tax, this trade tax component remains the business expense"
8349,The overpayment is to be booked as operating income at the time of receipt / offsetting
8350,"If the trade tax liability only occurred in the course of the 1990 calendar year and the tax rate was therefore not increased by a trade tax component, then in this case too, the trade tax for 1990 can only be recognized as a business expense in the amount in which other taxes from the first half of 1990 the were taken into account when determining the advance tax payments, ceased to exist in the second half of 1990 (e.g."
8351,"Production fund tax, payroll tax)"

8356,This means that capital gains in the first half of 1990 - in contrast to capital gains in the second half of 1990 - are always subject to separate taxation
8357,This also applies if losses from ongoing business operations occurred in the first half of 1990
8358,"If the separate taxation of capital gains for the first half of 1990 results in a tax, this will always be set at the calculated amount"
8359,Capital gains from the 2nd half of 1990 can be offset against negative current profits from both half-years
8360,"84 Offsetting of ongoing losses as well as loss carry-back from 1991/1992 to the second half of 1990 According to § 4 of the DB to the StÄG, both loss compensation within one type of income and loss compensation between several types of income are possible"

9565,The usufructuary with reservation is also not to be regarded as the beneficial owner of the built apartment
9566,"As a rule, an apartment is also acquired within the meaning of § 10e EStG if it was created by building work on the part of the person entitled to use it on third-party land and the owner of the property in exchange for his claim for expenses and compensation in connection with § 951 BGB § 812 BGB (see Sections 1 and 15 of the BMF letter)"
9567,"With the transfer of the property, the claim for expenses and compensation ceases to exist under civil law"
9568,An express declaration by the contracting parties about the treatment of the expense and compensation claim is therefore not required
9569,Acquisition costs of the building are now present in the amount of the lost expenditure and compensation claim
9570,It can be assumed that the estimated amount of the expense and compensation claim corresponds to the amount of the manufacturing costs borne by the taxpayer (Section 15 of the BMF letter)
9571,These production costs are not to be reduced by fictitious or possibly drawn depreciation amounts in the meantime
9572,The acquisition costs are entirely attributable to the building without the associated land (section 17 sentence 2 of the BMF letter)
9573,The waiver of the claim for expenses and compensation is thus comparable to the payment of a fee; its amount serves as the assessment basis for the deduction amount according to § 10e EStG
9574,"However, the tax relief under Section 10e EStG can only be used for the assessment period in which ownership, uses, encumbrances and risks of the property are transferred to the taxpayer"
9575,A waiver of the claim for expenses and compensation without transfer of ownership is not sufficient
9576,Example: S has been living in one of the apartments in his parents' two-family house for free since 1987
9577,"In 1988 he extended his apartment with the consent of his parents at his own expense for 50,000 DM"
9578,"In 1991, the taxpayers agreed that the property should be transferred to the son in return for payment of the expenses and compensation"
9579,"However, ownership, benefits and encumbrances of the property do not pass to the son until 1992"
9580,"Solution: By adding to the apartment he used himself, the son acquired a claim for expenses and compensation in accordance with Section 951 in conjunction with Section 812 of the German Civil Code (BGB) in the amount of DM 50,000"
9581,A consideration of the expenses according to § 10e EStG is not yet possible because the son has neither become the civil nor the economic owner of the extension
9582,"For the assessment period 1991, a tax relief according to § 10e EStG is also out of the question, as the taxpayer has waived the claim for expenses and compensation, but has not yet established any civil-legal ownership of the property"
9583,"With the transfer of the property in 1992, the acquisition costs of the building are now in the amount of the lost expenditure and compensation claim in the amount of DM 50,000"
9584,These acquisition costs relate entirely to the building without the associated land
9585,"However, since the present case is a two-family house, the acquisition costs are to be distributed over the two apartments in proportion to the usable area"
9586,"It is true that the taxpayer's construction work did not create a new apartment, as is expressly requested in the BMF letter"
9587,"This is merely an apartment extension that is favored according to Section 10e Paragraph 2 EStG, but the claim for reimbursement of expenses is to be treated as an acquisition expense in the course of the transfer of ownership of the building, with the result that it is a purchase transaction according to Section 10e Paragraph 1 Clause 4 EStG"
9588,The period between the completion of the construction work and the subsequent transfer of ownership is also irrelevant
9589,"Funding under Section 10e EStG is to be refused if, upon completion of the construction work before the assessment period 1987, the tax relief under Section 7b EStG would have been claimed (cf. BMF letter of 4 7 1986 BStBl Part I, page 318 ff), because this would lead to double funding for one and the same construction project"
9590,"According to Section 7 of the BMF letter, the person entitled to permanent residence within the meaning of Section 31 ff"
9591,"As a rule, WEG is to be regarded as the beneficial owner of the apartment"
9592,"The prerequisite, however, is that the taxpayer has signed a corresponding model legal contract for permanent residence under § 31 ff"
9593,WEG completes
9594,"Through this model contract, the person entitled to permanent residency is to achieve a position that equates him economically with an apartment owner"
9595,Permanent right of residence can be granted to an existing building or a building that is yet to be constructed
9596,The right of residence can be concluded for an unlimited period as well as for a particularly long period of time
9597,"If the right of residence is to correspond to the model contract, the following requirements must be met: It must in any case be alienable and inheritable"
9598,"In the event of a premature termination of the permanent right of residence, the property owner must pay the person entitled to permanent residence an appropriate compensation in the amount of the market value of the permanent right of residence"
9599,"After the expiry of the permanent right of residence, the owner is obliged to procure residential property for those entitled to permanent residence against the cancellation of the permanent right of residence"
9600,"For this purpose, a notarial notice of conveyance must be provided in the land register when the permanent right of residence is concluded"
9601,"If the person entitled to permanent residence assumes the financing of the purchase of the property and the building equipment as well as the interest and repayment of the borrowed capital as well as the ongoing management costs, he is to be regarded as the beneficial owner (BFH judgment of 22 October 1985 Federal Tax Gazette 1986 Part II page 258)"
9602,The assessment basis of § 10e EStG includes the acquisition costs for the long-term right of residence or the production costs borne by the person entitled to permanent residence
9603,The costs for the land are to be excluded from the assessment base in any case
9604,Example: S is granted permanent right of residence for the upper apartment in a two-family house
9605,"In return for the granting of permanent residence rights, S waives the repayment of a loan claim due from the property owner in the amount of DM 200,000"
9606,"Solution: Since S spends an amount of DM 200,000 on granting permanent residence rights, he is to be regarded as the beneficial owner of the upper apartment"
9607,"He can therefore take advantage of the tax relief under Section 10e EStG for the acquisition costs of DM 200,000"
9608,Example: The parents of the S allow him to build an apartment by adding another storey to their family house
9609,"S carried out the construction work on its own account in 1990 with a total expenditure of 150,000 DM"
9610,"After completion of the construction work in 1991, the parents grant the S permanent right of residence in the apartment he has built with a contract certified by a notary"
9611,Solution: S can claim the support of § 10e EStG for the apartment completed in 1991
9612,"The assessment basis within the meaning of Section 10e EStG is the production costs incurred by him in the amount of DM 150,000"
9613,"If, in the case of a construction project on third-party land, a permanent right of residence is granted immediately afterwards, a preliminary cost deduction is generally possible in accordance with Section 10e (6) of the Income Tax Act"
9614,"If the taxpayer has already moved into the apartment at the time the permanent right of residence is granted, he can claim the preliminary cost deduction in accordance with Section 10e (6) EStG up to the point in time at which he has become the beneficial owner of the apartment"
9615,"III Apartment in one's own house - relevant point in time According to section 8 of the BMF letter of 15 5 1987 (BStBl 1987 I page 434), the actual design at the time of moving into the apartment used for one's own residential purposes was decisive for the tax reduction under Section 10e EStG"
9616,"In this respect, there was a change compared to the existing regulation under Section 7b of the Income Tax Act, according to which the design at the time of manufacture or acquisition must be taken into account when determining the beneficiary property (Section 54 Paragraph 1 Clause 4 EStR 1987)"
9617,Section 9 of the BMF letter of 25 October 1990 does not contain any corresponding regulation
9618,"Now, when applying Section 10e EStG, a separate check must be made for each assessment period to determine the amount of acquisition / production costs for the owner-occupied apartment in the sense of valuation law"
9619,"Example: A purchases a two-family house in the 1988 calendar year for DM 400,000 plus DM 100,000 for the land"
9620,"He moves into the ground floor apartment in the same calendar year, the upper floor apartment is initially rented"
9621,"After the tenant moved out in 1990, A converted the house into a single-family house and used it for his own residential purposes"
9622,"Solution: In the calendar years 1988 and 1989, A can benefit from tax incentives in accordance with Section 10e (1) EStG in the amount of 5 percent"
9623,"deduct from 225,000 DM (1/2 of 400,000 DM plus 1/4 of 100,000 DM) for the owner-occupied ground floor apartment as special expenses"
9624,"From the assessment period 1990 to 1995, the deduction amount according to § 10e EStG in the amount of 5 percent"
9625,"of 300,000 DM (maximum assessment basis) can be taken into account to reduce tax"
9626,"IV Extensions and extensions Because of the terms extension and extension, reference is made to Section 17 of the II Housing Act (WoBauG) (BStBl 1990 I page 424 and Annex 3 EStR 1990)"
9627,An expansion i
9628,Section 17 (1) II WoBauG and Section 10e (2) EStG are also to be assumed if previous ancillary or accessory rooms are structurally converted into (main) living spaces in the narrower sense using significant construction costs (e.g.
9629,Expansion of a basement room into a children's room)
9630,Considerable construction costs are to be assumed here if the construction costs incurred are at least 1/3 of the costs that would be proportionately attributable to corresponding living spaces if the building were assumed to be new
9631,Modifications to an apartment only lead to extensions i
9632,"Section 10e EStG, if the living spaces were unsuitable for residential purposes due to the change in living conditions"
9633,"It is not sufficient that the living spaces were in need of repair (BFH judgment of April 28, 1992 BStBl 1992 Part II, page 823)"
9634,The requirements of Section 10e (2) EStG are also met when a taxpayer first builds ancillary and accessory rooms to the owner-occupied apartment (e.g.
9635,"a laundry room, storage or drying room)"
9636,"In any case, the expansion or expansion must be carried out in a spatial context with the owner-occupied apartment"
9637,"It is sufficient if, after completion, both the extension or the extension and the apartment itself are used (Section 11 of the BMF letter)"
9638,"Example: A acquires a two-family house in the 1990 calendar year free of charge in anticipated succession, the upper floor apartment of which is rented"
9639,"After building an extension to the two-family house at a price of 100,000 DM, he moved into the ground floor apartment in 1992 after completion"
9640,The same-sized part of the extension located on the upper floor will be rented out after completion
9641,Solution: A can deduct a deduction amount of 5 percent from the assessment period 1992 in accordance with § 10e EStG
9642,"of the pro rata production costs of 50,000 DM = 2,500 DM"
9643,The expenses incurred for the rented part are to be included as subsequent production costs in the depreciation assessment basis
9644,Manufacturing costs for an expansion or
9645,"An extension to a single-family house used for one's own residential purposes, for which the increased deductions according to § 7b EStG by way of the ""small transitional regulation"" (§ 52 para 2 EStG must be taken into account (section 32 sentence 2 of the BMF letter; confirmed by BFH judgment of October 4, 1990 BStBl 1991 II page 221)"
9646,"However, the taxpayer regularly has the option of waiving the unused deduction amounts according to Section 7b EStG"
9647,This can be advantageous in individual cases if the possible application of Section 10e Paragraph 2 EStG results in a higher tax reduction in accordance with Section 34f Paragraph 2 or 3 EStG
9648,Manufacturing costs for an expansion or
9649,"An extension of an apartment used for own residential purposes that falls under the ""Large Transitional Regulation"" (Section 52 (21) sentence 2 EStG) and for which the taxpayer has not yet waived the value-in-use taxation, cannot benefit under Section 10e (2) EStG (Section 4 of the BMF letter)"
9650,"Rather, the production costs increase the depreciation assessment basis of the owner-occupied apartment, at the same time the rental value for the newly created living space must be recorded (BFH judgment of 5 8 1992 X R 23/92 DStZ 92 S"
9651,768)
9652,"It can therefore be more favorable in individual cases if the taxpayer waives the ""Large Transitional Regulation"" and takes advantage of the tax relief under Section 10e (2) EStG"
9653,Is in the expansion or
9654,"If a new apartment is built through the extension, the taxpayer's expenses can only be subsidized in accordance with Section 10e (1) EStG"
9655,"In this respect, no expansion or"
9656,"No extension given to an apartment used for own residential purposes (judgment of the FG Münster dated 20 10 1992 Az 6 K 5468/89 E, not published)"
9657,Example: In 1989 A acquires a building for commercial purposes free of charge
9658,"In the course of the 1989 calendar year, A had a kitchen connection, a bath / toilet, a shower and a staircase built into this building"
9659,"In addition, expenses were incurred for re-covering the roof (no changes to the roof construction)"
9660,The existing building is being redesigned using the foundations and the load-bearing parts (interior and exterior walls) and has been used by A for its own residential purposes since 1 5 1990
9661,"The construction costs incurred by A in this connection amount to DM 105,000"
9662,"Solution: A did not create a new building due to the construction work carried out (Section 2 of the BMF letter of 17 2 1992 BStBl Part I, page 115)"
9663,"Nevertheless, in the present case, A receives the basic subsidy according to § 10e Abs 1 EStG because he has built an apartment in his own house (assessment basis DM 105,000)"
9664,The expenses favored according to § 10e Abs 2 EStG do not include the proportional costs for the land (section 12 sentence 3 of the BMF letter)
9665,The use of the tax breaks according to § 34f EStG i
9666,Section 10e (2) EStG is in the case of an extension i
9667,Section 17 (2) II WoBauG or
9668,"in the case of an extension of the top floor by the end of 1991, it does not depend on the amount of the expenses borne by the property owner"
9669,They are to be granted even if the tax reduction according to § 34f EStG already exceeds the construction costs
9670,A limitation of the tax relief according to § 34f EStG was introduced for the first time by the Tax Amendment Act 1992 of 25 2 1992 (cf. order of 5 3 1992 - S-2225a - 165 - St 12 - 31)
9671,"According to Section 34f (4) sentence 1 EStG, the taxpayer can only claim the Baukindergeld up to the amount of the assessment basis of the deductible amounts according to Section 10e (1) or 2 EStG"
9672,This limitation applies for the first time to objects that were acquired or manufactured in the assessment period 1992
9673,"V Subsequent production costs in the case of partially paid acquisition In the case of a partially paid acquisition, the acquisition process is divided into a paid and a free part according to the ratio of the fee to the market value of the entire asset"
9674,The ancillary acquisition costs are not taken into account in this ratio determination
9675,"Rather, they are later to be added directly in full to the acquisition costs (see BFH judgment of 10 10 1991 BStBl 1992 Part II, page 239)"
9676,"If subsequent acquisition costs are incurred later in the case of a partially paid acquisition, these are not to be divided between the paid and unpaid part of the acquisition"
9677,"Rather, they fully increase the assessment basis of Section 10e EStG for the part of the apartment purchased for a fee"
9678,Example: In 1991 the parents transferred a condominium to their son through anticipated inheritance regulation
9679,"The market value of the apartment is 300,000 DM"
9680,"S undertakes to pay his sister an equal opportunity allowance of DM 150,000"
9681,"Immediately after the transfer of the apartment, S begins building a winter garden that can be used all year round"
9682,"Its production costs amount to 30,000 DM"
9683,"When the apartment was transferred, incidental acquisition costs of DM 10,000 were incurred"
9684,"Overall, the condominium is used by S for its own residential purposes"
9685,"For the sake of simplicity, the share of land is DM 0"
9686,Solution: The condominium acquired by S by way of the anticipated inheritance regulation in 1991 is a partially paid purchase transaction
9687,"S paid his sister acquisition costs of DM 150,000 in the amount of the equal opportunities allowance"
9688,"In relation to the market value of the property (300,000 DM), half of this is a paid and the other half is a purchase transaction free of charge"
9689,The incidental acquisition costs are directly attributable to the purchase transaction against payment
9690,"The subsequent production costs in the amount of 30,000 DM would not be favored as an extension if strictly considered to a second new property according to § 10e Paragraph 2 EStG because of the spatial context"
9691,"In these cases, however, there are no concerns about treating these expenses as subsequent production costs, which are nevertheless favored according to § 10e EStG"
9692,"Acquisition costs: 150,000 DM Incidental acquisition costs: 10,000 DM Subsequent acquisition costs: 30,000 DM Total: 190000 DMVI Follow-up property For a follow-up property, Section 10e EStG in its current version at the time of acquisition or manufacture is decisive"
9693,"However, only the percentages of the years remaining from the first object are decisive"
9694,"Example: A has claimed deductions for a single-family house built in 1990 and sold again on June 1, 1992, in accordance with Section 10 (1) EStG for the assessment periods 1990 to 1992"
9695,"With a notarized sales contract dated July 1, 1993, he acquires a condominium that he uses for his own residential purposes from the time of purchase"
9696,"A makes use of the subsequent property regulation in accordance with Section 10, Paragraph 4, Clause 4 of the Income Tax Act"
9697,Solution: The new degressive design of § 10e Abs 1 EStG with the deduction rate of 6 percent
9698,affects the subsequent property in the 1993 assessment period
9699,The deduction period for the first property spanned the years 1990 to 1992. The basic funding allowed for this was therefore 3 x 5 percent
9700,", at most DM 15,000 each"
9701,"The subsequent property is a property within the meaning of Section 10e, Paragraph 1 of the Income Tax Act in the version of the Tax Amendment Act 1992. Accordingly, the degressive deduction rates are generally to be applied, but the years used for the first property must be taken into account when calculating the percentages"
9702,This means that the deduction period for the subsequent property includes the years 1993 to 1997 and the remaining deductible amounts from the 4th to the 8th year for the first property
9703,The basic funding for the assessment period 1993 is therefore 6 per cent
9704,", at most DM 19,800"
9705,"For the years 1994 to 1997, 4 x 5 percent"
9706,"up to a maximum of 16,500 DM each"
9707,"As part of the subsequent property regulation, it may also be possible to claim the extended debt interest deduction in accordance with Section 10e (6a) of the Income Tax Act for the subsequent property"
9708,"For clarification, reference is made in this context to the following example"
9709,"Example: S made use of the deductions for a single-family house purchased in 1991 and sold again on June 1, 1993, in accordance with Section 10e, Paragraph 1 of the Income Tax Act for the assessment periods 1991 to 1993"
9710,"In 1992, S built another property, which he used for his own residential purposes after the single-family house was sold in 1993"
9711,"S makes use of the subsequent property regulation in accordance with Section 10e, Paragraph 4, Clause 4 of the Income Tax Act"
9712,"In the individual years from the assessment period 1992 onwards, he pays debt interest of DM 15,000 annually"
9713,"Solution: Since the subsequent property is a property within the meaning of Section 10e EStG Paragraph 1 EStG in the version of the Tax Amendment Act 1992, S can in principle claim the debt interest deduction for the property in accordance with Section 10e Paragraph 6 a EStG"
9714,"However, the prerequisite is that the taxpayer claims the deduction amounts for this property in accordance with Section 10e Paragraph 1 or 2 EStG"
9715,"A debt interest deduction is therefore ruled out for the assessment period 1992, since the taxpayer has not yet used the subsequent property for his own residential purposes"
9716,"For the assessment period 1993, a debt interest deduction in accordance with § 10e Paragraph 6 a EStG is also not possible, as the taxpayer still takes advantage of the basic subsidy for the first property according to § 10e Paragraph 1 EStG"
9717,"Accordingly, he can only deduct debt interest up to a maximum of DM 12,000 for the 1994 assessment period in accordance with Section 10e (6a) of the Income Tax Act"
9718,A recovery of the debt interest deduction not used in 1992 according to § 10e Paragraph 6 a Sentence 2 EStG in the calendar year 1995 is ruled out because in 1992 the conditions for claiming the debt interest deduction according to § 10e Paragraph 6 a EStG did not exist Taxpayers could not take advantage of the tax relief of § 10e Abs 1 EStG for the subsequent property
9719,"VII § 10e EStG in the case of owners' associations The administrative opinion presented under V 1, Paragraph 2 in my reference order of 18 11 1988 is now outdated (BFH judgment of 12 2 1988 BStBl Part II, page 764 principle of legal jurisdiction over joint property)"
9720,"According to section 27 of the BMF letter, the co-owner of a two-family house can claim all of his expenses for the owner-occupied apartment within the framework of Section 10e Paragraph 1 Clause 1 or Paragraph 2 EStG if his co-ownership share is in relation to the value of the apartment used for his own residential purposes Value of the building"
9721,"VIII § 10e Abs 6 EStG The deductible expenses of a taxpayer according to § 10e Abs 6 EStG do not include the deductions for wear and tear in accordance with § 7 EStG, see FG Munich, judgment of 21 5 1992 K 4660/90 NWB Eilnachrichten 1992 p"

9723,I3: acquisition costs for a heritable building right)
9724,Expenses i
9725,Section 10e (6) of the Income Tax Act only applies if there is a direct connection with the owner-occupied apartment
9726,"A consideration of futile costs such as special expenses is therefore ruled out (Paragraph 56 of the BMF letter, BFH judgment of 17 7 1991 BStBl II page 916)"
9727,Expenses for trips to obtain loan offers to finance the or
9728,Self-used residential property to be purchased can be deducted like special expenses if they are directly related to the owner-occupied residential property and if it is a question of financing costs (Section 50 of the BMF letter)
9729,Operating costs (e.g.
9730,Property tax and building insurance premiums) can be deducted in the year of payment up to the amount in which they apply to the period up to the first use of the apartment for personal residential purposes
9731,Reference is made to the statements in Section 54 of the BMF letter
9732,"According to Section 10e, Paragraph 6 of the Income Tax Act (EStG), expenses can also be deducted that the taxpayer had incurred prior to the first use of an extension or extension of the apartment used for their own residential purposes (Section 61 of the BMF letter)"
9733,"Expenses related to subsequent production costs are not deductible according to Section 10e, Paragraph 6 of the Income Tax Act"
9734,"If a taxpayer acquires an apartment free of charge, he can reimburse the expenses incurred until moving into the apartment i"
9735,Only claim against § 10e (6) EStG for tax purposes if he is the universal successor and the testator has not previously used the apartment for his own residential purposes
9736,"In a judgment of 11 3 1992, the BFH, contrary to Section 49 of the BMF letter, takes the view that expenses incurred prior to moving in for the renovation of an apartment used for one's own residential purposes can be deducted according to Section 10e (6) EStG, even in the case of free individual legal succession of the apartment"
9737,This interpretation is doubtful with regard to the wording as well as the meaning and purpose of the provision
9738,"The judgment is not to be applied beyond the decided individual case, also with regard to other similar proceedings pending at the BFH (BStBl 1992 Part I, page 584)"
9739,Comparable legal remedy procedures can continue to be suspended with the consent of the Stpfl (cf.
9740,"In the case of a partially paid acquisition, a differentiated assessment of the tax case is required according to the administrative opinion: Example: A, B and C are in equal parts heirs of their father V, who died in January 01. The inheritance essentially consists of a single-family house (market value DM 450,000, including the reason and land 75,000 DM), which V used for his own residential purposes until his death"
9741,"A takes over the shares of the siblings (market value of the two shares: 300,000 DM, including land and land share 50,000 DM) in July 01 against compensation payments of 75,000 DM each (total"
9742,"150,000 DM)"
9743,"After the renovation of the building (construction costs: 12,000 DM), A moved into the house in December 01 and used it for his own residential purposes from then on"
9744,"To finance the compensation payments, A takes out a loan, for which he pays DM 15,000 in debt interest in 01"
9745,Solution: A has become 1/3 universal successor to V.
9746,"The renovation costs of 4,000 DM attributable to this share represent maintenance expenses"
9747,"However, they cannot be used as initial costs i"
9748,"Section 10e (6) of the Income Tax Act (EStG) must be taken into account in a tax-reducing manner, since V had used the single-family house for his own residential purposes until his death (not first-time use, A takes on the legal status of his father)"
9749,"A acquired the co-ownership shares of his siblings (2/3 of the property) against payment of DM 150,000 in part for consideration"
9750,"In this respect, he is entitled to the deduction amount according to Section 10e (1) EStG"
9751,The maximum amount according to § 10e Abs 1 EStG is not reduced (section 16 of the BMF letter)

9755,"On the other hand, the debt interest paid by A in the amount of DM 15,000 is fully deductible as preliminary costs in accordance with Section 10e (6) of the Income Tax Act (EStG), since it only applies to the part of the single-family home that has been acquired against payment"

9764,"The purchase price is due in one sum on February 28, 1994"
9765,"The market value of the property is DM 360,000"
9766,Solution: The acquisition of the single-family house in anticipated succession is a partially paid purchase transaction
9767,"S has acquisition costs within the meaning of § 10e EStG in the amount of the discounted present value of the equality allowances, since in the present case it is a non-interest-bearing cash benefit with a term of more than one year"
9768,"Based on the provisions of the Valuation Act, this results in a purchase price of DM 179,690"
9769,"The taxpayer can claim the interest portion of 20,310 DM up to an amount of 12,000 DM in the 1994 assessment period when paying as debt interest in accordance with Section 10e (6a) of the Income Tax Act"

9784,The acquisition costs of the land included in the assessment base according to Section 10e (1) EStG cannot be included in the determination of the depreciation assessment basis for depreciation in accordance with Section 7 EStG
9785,"According to section 43, paragraph 6, sentence 3, no"

9792,"The binding effect of this option already results from the application of the taxpayer in the assessment procedure, not only from the final tax assessment for the first assessment period for which no further value in use is to be recorded (see section II number 4 of the BMF letter of 19 September 1986 BStBl I Page 480 Decree of FM NRW of 19 9 1986 communicated by circular order of 13 10 1986 - S-2225a - 154 - St 16 - 31)"
9793,The application can therefore not be revoked in the appeal procedure (cf. judgment of the FG Bremen of 23 2 1990 EFG 1990 page 528; also: FG Münster dated 11 9 1991 Az
9794,: 13 K 2923/90 E (not published))
9795,"However, for reasons of equity, the tax authorities allow an exception to the irrevocability of the application for the discontinuation of the value-in-use taxation if the tax office divides the expenses into a non-deductible amount and an amount that can be deducted as income from renting and leasing as income-related expenses deviates at the expense of the taxpayer (circular order of the OFD Münster from 27 9 1989 - S-2225a - 154 - St 16 - 31 ESt-Nr 74/1989)"

9801,"If a building is co-owned by several people and the co-owners each use an apartment of the house corresponding to their co-ownership share, each co-owner can submit the application in accordance with Section 52 (21) sentence 3 EStG alone"
9802,"According to the principle of legal jurisdiction over joint property (see V above), only the co-owner who uses the individual apartment for his own residential purposes fulfills the requirements of Section 52 (21) sentence 2 EStG"
9803,The other co-owners were not assigned any value in use for this apartment in the 1986 assessment period either

9805,"II 4 sentence 5 of the decree of the Minister of Finance NRW dated 19 September 1986 and section 157 (2) sentence 6 EStR, a taxpayer who has distributed larger maintenance expenses according to § 82b, § 82h or § 82k EStDV can deduct the expenses not yet deducted in one amount deduct in the assessment period for which the value in use is to be recognized for the last time as a result of an option pursuant to Section 52 (21) sentence 3 EStG"
9806,The same applies according to No.

9808,Decree for § 21a objects for which the distribution of larger maintenance costs was permitted in accordance with Section 157 (2) sentences 6 10 and 11 of the EStR 1987
9809,If the tax assessment of the assessment period for which a value in use is taxed for the last time is already final and the taxpayer has inadvertently paid the maintenance expenses that have not yet been deducted (e.g.
9810,from ignorance of the above
9811,"Instruction) or because he initially wanted to continue the value-in-use taxation, was not asserted in this assessment period, the income tax assessment can be corrected at the request of the taxpayer, since the o"
9812,"Provision for the immediate deduction of the remainder of the maintenance expenses not taken into account so far is an equitable measure, which in this respect is a basic notice for the ESt notice"
9813,The income tax assessment can therefore be changed in accordance with Section 175 (1) No. 1 AO
9814,"With judgment of 14 11 1990 VII 2386/89 E (not published), the FG Münster has maintenance expenses that a taxpayer had in 1985 for his single-family house used for his own residential purposes and spread over five years in accordance with § 82b EStDV in the calendar year 1987 as subsequent Advertising costs are taken into account in the income from renting and leasing, although the single-family house is exempt from value-in-use taxation by law from the assessment period 1987 under the Home Ownership Promotion Act"
9815,"Since, according to the case law, the elimination of the respective type of income does not preclude the assertion of subsequent business expenses, the distribution of expenses already made, as regulated by law, must continue to apply"
9816,An appeal against this judgment is pending at the BFH under file number IX R 14/91
9817,"According to the small transitional regulation of Section 52 (21) sentence 4 EStG, increased deductions according to Section 7b EStG and the extended debt interest deduction according to Section 21a (4) EStG can be deducted as special expenses"
9818,This can lead to income tax disadvantages if the amount of certain income or the total amount of income is taxable (e.g.
9819,"with §§ 10b, 10d, 14a, 18 Abs 4 EStG 1987 24a, 33 46 Abs 2 Nr 1 EStG)"
9820,"The legislature consciously accepted these far-reaching effects, which were also known when the Home Ownership Promotion Act was passed"
9821,There are therefore no reasons for a different tax assessment for objective reasons of equity

9824,It is therefore necessary to adapt follow-up notices to the basic notices within the framework laid down by law
9825,"The adjustment norm is Section 175, Paragraph 1, Clause 1, No. 1 AO"
9826,This provision is supplemented by statute of limitations in Section 171 (10) AO
9827,"Thereafter, the assessment period does not end before the end of one year after the notification of the basic decision, insofar as this is binding for the assessment of a tax"
9828,"2 The one-year period of Section 171 (10) AO begins with the notification of the basic notification, not with the receipt of the notification of its outcome by the FÄ responsible for issuing the follow-up notification"
9829,"The FA responsible for issuing the basic decision must therefore ensure that the notifications about the established tax bases are sent to the for the immediately afterwards, if possible at the same time as the notification of the basic decision, but at least if this is not possible due to special circumstances in individual cases Issue of the follow-up notices to the competent FÄ"
9830,Withholding the messages e.g.
9831,until the basic decision becomes final is not permitted
9832,3 The FÄ responsible for issuing the follow-up notices are required to adjust the follow-up notices immediately upon receipt of the aforementioned notifications
9833,It is to be expected that an adjustment to several basic notices will be necessary (example: Der Stpflg
9834,"is involved in several partnerships and / or communities), you should refrain from collecting the messages for joint evaluation"
9835,The immediate adjustment in each case avoids overlooking the expiry of the one-year period of Section 171 (10) AO and other procedural problems
9836,The evaluation must take place even if the basic decision is contested
9837,Any suggestion by the FA responsible for issuing the basic decision to postpone the amendment of the follow-up decision until the appeal proceedings have been concluded must under no circumstances be taken into account
9838,"4 If the responsibility for issuing the follow-up notices has changed, the FA, which was previously responsible, must immediately forward the notification of the established tax bases"
9839,"The FA, which has newly become responsible, then has to inform the FA responsible for the basic notices about the change of responsibility in those cases in which separate findings are to be expected in the future"
9840,"5 If, in individual cases, the follow-up notification has not been adapted to a basic notification, it can be done within the - possibly"
9841,The deadline that is inhibited in its expiry can be made up at any time
9842,This also applies if the basic decision could have been taken into account when an earlier tax assessment (subsequent assessment) was issued (see BFH rulings of 9 8 1983 BStBl 1984 II p

9846,"Example: In the case of the income tax assessment 01 carried out in 03, the income from a commercial participation was set at 10,000 DM as explained, although the FA had already received an income tax 4 B notification at this point in time, according to which the profit attributable to the tax ( share) has been determined to DM 50,000 by decision of 100103"
9847,This notification was also overlooked when the income tax assessment was changed in 04
9848,In 05 the FA noticed the oversight
9849,"Solution: The ESt notification 01 must be changed in accordance with Section 175 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 No. 1 AO, since this provision does not leave the adjustment of the follow-up notification at the discretion of the FA"
9850,The fact that an adjustment of the income tax notification 01 was already possible before 05 is irrelevant
9851,Section 175 (1) sentence 1 no
9852,is the case with Section 173 AO
9853,"The regulation of § 175, Paragraph 1, Sentence 1, No. 1 AO breaks through the institute of legal certainty and gives priority to the principle of uniformity of taxation, i.e. the material correctness of tax assessment"
9854,"A change is also not opposed to § 169 Paragraph 1 Clause 1 AO, as the general fixing period does not end until 311205"
9855,It is therefore irrelevant that the one-year period of Section 171 (10) AO ended with the expiry of 090104

9860,"In the case of the income tax assessment, the residence tax office used the share of the current profit communicated to it, but not the capital gain as the tax base"
9861,"Solution: If the assessment period has not yet expired, the ESt notification must be adapted to the basic notification"
9862,"The adjustment is also imperative if the FA, when issuing the original income tax assessment, confirms the legal significance of the basic assessment on the question of recording the capital gain (e.g."
9863,because of Section 16 (4) of the Income Tax Act) and has therefore not adopted the content of the basic decision or not correctly adopted it in the subsequent decision
9864,"In such a case, the provision of Section 175, Paragraph 1, Clause 1, No. 1 serves to correct errors that have been made in the evaluation of notifications on established tax bases"
9865,"7 The obligation to - fully - adapt the follow-up decision to the basic decision still exists if the basic decision, which was initially not or incorrectly evaluated, is changed later"
9866,"In this case, the amendment of the follow-up notification is required to bring about a materially correct result, even if it serves to make up for a previously neglected adjustment of the follow-up notification"
9867,That u
9868,"the one-year period of Section 171 (10) AO has already expired, based on the basic decision that was initially not or incorrectly evaluated, is irrelevant; a ""use up"" of the possibility to adapt the follow-up decision to the changed basic decision does not occur (not officially published BFH judgment of 17 2 1993 - II R 15/91)"
9869,"However, the adjustment must now take place within one year of the notification of the changed basic decision"
9870,"Example: In the income tax assessment for the year 01, an income tax 4 B notification from 100302 was overlooked (profit share: 10,000 DM)"
9871,"After the assessment period has expired (§§ 169 Paragraph 2 Clause 1 No. 2 170 Paragraph 2 No. 1 and 171 Paragraph 10 AO), an amended basic decision is issued in 09 in which the Stpfl was now allocated a share of the income amounting to DM 50,000"
9872,"Solution: Within the one-year period (Section 171 (10) AO) that began in 09, the ESt notification 01 can be remitted to the changed basic notification in full and not just in the amount of 40,000 DM (50,000 DM according to"

9875,Message from 100302)
9876,"8 In addition, it is not necessary to check whether the beginning of the annual period of Section 171 (10) AO lies within the regular or for other reasons inhibited deadline"
9877,"If a basic decision has been issued admissibly because the deadline applicable for its issuance has not yet expired, the subsequent decision can in any case be adjusted within one year of its announcement (BFH judgment of 12.8 1987 BStBl 1988 II p"

9880,425)
9881,It follows from this that the notifications received during an ongoing external audit about established tax bases that relate to the audit period must also be evaluated immediately because of the one-year deadline of Section 171 (10) AO
9882,The tax files required for this must be requested from the auditor
9883,"If, on the other hand, an external audit extends to the tax bases to be determined separately, then, contrary to the legal situation prior to the entry into force of the AO 1977 according to §§ 171 para 4 and 181 para 1 AO, there is only an inhibition of the assessment period, but not an inhibition of the assessment period (assessment period) for connected to the follow-up notices (BFH judgment of 4 4 1989 BStBl 1989 II p"

9892,821)
9893,The same applies if only individual tax bases are eliminated from the assessment procedure by changing the basic assessment
9894,"In this case, too, the FA responsible for issuing the follow-up notification must independently determine and evaluate the facts that are no longer included in the assessment procedure, without being bound by previous assessments or calculations (BFH judgment of 11 4 1990 BFH / NV 1991 p"
9895,143)
9896,"Example: Due to an external audit, the company tax office does not recognize co-entrepreneurship between X and Y."
9897,"It has therefore revoked the decision on the separate and uniform determination of the tax bases, which was issued subject to review, and rejected the application for determination of the income"
9898,"Solution: After the revocation of the basic decision, the tax offices responsible for X and Y must independently check the extent to which income has been generated"
9899,"Subsequently, the follow-up notices in accordance with Section 175, Paragraph 1, Clause 1, No. 1 AO must be amended accordingly"
9900,"12 In the event of a change to a follow-up notification that becomes necessary in accordance with Section 175 (1) Sentence 1 No. 1 AO, legal errors within the framework of Section 177 AO must be corrected"
9901,"The obligation to correct ex officio exists both in the case of errors that had worked in favor of the Stpfl, as well as those that had worked in its disadvantage"
9902,The correction must also be carried out if the legal errors themselves require a correction option according to §§ 172 ff
9903,AO could no longer open because of the statute of limitations (BFH judgment of 18 12 1991 BStBl 1992 II p
9904,504)
9905,"If the tax effects of an ""opposing"" legal error are the same as or greater than those that result from the change in accordance with Section 175 (1) sentence 1 no. )"
9906,"In this case, it must be put on record that and why, despite the existence of the notification of the issuance or change of the basic decision, the amendment of the follow-up decision is not carried out"
9907,"If the Stpfl applies for the amendment of the follow-up notification, but has to refrain from doing so for the above reasons, the adjustment is to be rejected by notification (with a corresponding justification)"
9908,This gives the taxpayer the opportunity to have the application of the provision of § 177 AO checked in the appeal procedure (§ 348 Paragraph 2 AO)
9909,"13 In cases in which a participation in a depreciation company (for the procedure for the assertion of negative income from participation in loss allocation companies and comparable models see AO card index, § 180 AO, General, Map 2) is permissible either to special business assets or to the assets of a Company whose profit is to be determined separately according to § 180 Paragraph 1 No. 2 b AO, there is a risk of double consideration of the (proportionate) negative income"
9910,"In the past, for example, the ESt 4B notifications received by the residence tax office about the proportional losses at a depreciation company (due to lack of knowledge of the situation) were evaluated and the notices changed, although these losses were already determined separately in accordance with Section 180 (1) No. 2 b AO had been taken into account and had therefore already had an impact on the income tax assessment"
9911,"In order to avoid this, especially if no negative income from a participation is declared in the income tax declaration and an income tax 4B notification about negative (proportionate) income is available for the first time, the question of whether the participation belongs to a business asset of the partner should be addressed to be followed up"

9916,A deferral of the taxes determined by the follow-up notification solely on the basis of the objection lodged against the basic notification is also out of the question
